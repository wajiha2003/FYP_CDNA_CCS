 were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,
Your name When I lay with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together nothing gets better 'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name,
Your name I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Well, it felt something died
'Cause I knew that that was
The last time, the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door,
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,
Your name I set fire to the rain,
And I threw us into the flames
Well, it felt something died
'Cause I knew that, that was the last time
The last time Let it burn
Let it burn
Let it burn Daydreamer
Sitting on the sea
Soaking up the sun
He is a real lover
And making up the past
Feeling up his girl
Like he's never felt a figure before A jaw dropper
Looks good when he walks
Is the subject of their talk
He would be hard to chase
But good to catch
And he could change the world
With his hands behind his back, oh You can find him sittin' on your doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And you can tell that he'll be there for life Daydreamer
With eyes that make you melt
He lends his coat for shelter
Plus he's there for you
When he shouldn't be
But he stays all the same
Waits for you
Then sees you through There's no way I
Could describe him
What I'll say is
Just what I'm hoping for But I will find him sittin' on my doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And I can tell that he'll be there for life
And I can tell that he'll be there for life With your loving, there ain't nothing
That I can't adore
The way I'm running, with you, honey
Is we can break every low
I find it funny that you're the only
One I never looked for
There is something in your loving
That tears down my walls I wasn't ready then, I'm ready now
I'm heading straight for you
You will only be eternally
The one that I belong to The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I've known I'll forever be whatever you want me to be
I'll go under and all over for your clarity
When you wonder if I'm gonna lose my way home
Just remember, that come whatever, I'll be yours all alone I wasn't ready then, I'm ready now
I'm heading straight for you
You will only be eternally
The one that I belong to The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I've known I've been looking for you, baby
In every face that I've ever known
And there is something 'bout the way you love me
That finally feels like home
All my life, you're my darkness
You're the right kind of madness
And you're my hope, you're my despair
You're my scope, everything, everywhere The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I've known Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Devotion [Verse 1]
When did it go wrong, I will never know
I have loved you all my life
How did it slow down, I go round and round
Thinking about it all the time [Pre-Chorus]
I gave you heaven on a platter baby
I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me
This love, it ain't over yet
There's too much that I haven't said [Chorus]
Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write, had a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go [Verse 2]
Why were you so cold, let the truth be told
Tell me was it all for the thrill?
What was I thinking, I gave you everything
But you still went for the kill [Pre-Chorus]
I gave you heaven on a platter baby
I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me [Chorus]
Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write, had a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go [Bridge]
Oooh sometimes I feel like I'm in the dark
Oooh I thought I'd die in your arms [Chorus]
Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write, I had a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go [Outro]
Hope you know, I won't let go I thought I told you, he'd be home soon
Couldn't help myself, you're too good to be true.
I fall short each time,
Every time he ain't here
You and your charm creep closer
Closer and near
Like a fool for fire, I fall, with my pride and all.
Like a bomb before explosion,
Ticking by your call,
You're the wiser one, disguised from greed,
And I'm just a child who belongs on her knees. But I found a boy who I love more,
Than I ever did you before,
So stand beside the river I cried,
And lay yourself down.
Look how you want me now that I don't need you. So, you thought that I'd crumble to my knees
At the first sight of you crawling back to me
To whisper "will you leave your man? "
Cause you swear that this time you can stand by me.
I won't stand by you. Cause I found a boy who I love more,
Than I ever did you before,
So stand beside the river I cried
And lay yourself down.
Look how you want me now that I don't need you! I ain't yours for no taking,
You must be mistaken
I could never look into your eyes, and settle for wrong
And ignore the right When I found a boy who loves me more,
Than you ever did me before.
So stand beside the river you cried
And lay yourself down!
Look how you want me now that I don't need you! Found myself today singing out your name,
You said I'm crazy,
If I am I'm crazy for you. Sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here
Turns me crazy,
But it's you who makes me lose my head. And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head
And turn me into a crumbling fool. Tell me to run and I'll race,
If you want me to stop I'll freeze,
And if you want me gone. I'll leave, just hold me closer baby,
And make me crazy for you.
Crazy for you. Lately with this state I'm in I can't help myself but spin.
I wish you'd come over,
Send me spinning closer to you. My oh my, how my blood boils, it's sweet taste for you,
Strips me down bare
And gets me into my favorite mood. I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away,
But the more I do,
The crazier I turn into. Pacing floors and opening doors,
Hoping you'll walk through
And save me boy,
Because I'm too crazy for you.
Crazy for you Everybody tells me it's 'bout time that I moved on
And I need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young
But my heart is a valley, it's so shallow and man made
I'm scared to death if I let you in that you'll see I'm just a fake
Sometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch
But I know that's just me, 'cause nothing ever is enough
When I was a child I grew up by the River Lea
There was something in the water, now that something's in me
Oh I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river But it's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain But it's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea I should probably tell you now before it's way too late
That I never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face
Consider this my apology, I know it's years in advance
But I'd rather say it now in case I never get the chance
No, I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river But it's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain It's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea I never woulda hitch-hiked to Birmingham
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda caught the train to Louisiana
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda run through the blindin' rain
Without one dollar to my name
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love I never woulda seen the trouble that I'm in
If it hadn't been for love
Woulda been gone like a wayward wind
If it hadn't been for love
Nobody knows it better than me
I wouldn't be wishing I was free
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love Four cold walls against my will
At least I know he's lying still
Four cold walls without parole
Lord have mercy on my soul Four cold walls against my will
At least I know he's lying still
Four cold walls without parole
Lord have mercy on my soul I never woulda hitch-hiked to Birmingham
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda caught the train to Louisiana
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda loaded up a forty-four
Put myself behind a jailhouse door
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love, yes
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love, yes Hold my hand while you cut me down
It had only just begun but now it's over now
And you're in the heat of moments with your heart playing up cold
I'm between the middle watching hastiness unfold
On my eyes you were smiling in the spotlight dancing with the night
The night
When I fell off your mind I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Oy, I'm tired Where'd you go when you stayed behind
I looked up and inside down and outside only to find
A double taking punching hard and laughing at my smile
I get closer you obviously prefer her I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Oy, I'm tired (I should have known) Never mind said your open arms
I couldn't help believe they tricked me back into them, even though I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Oy, I'm tired Who wants to be right as rain
It's better when something is wrong
You get excitement in your bones
And everything you do's a game
When night comes and you're on your own
You can say I chose to be alone
Who wants to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top 'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love Who wants to be riding high
When you'll just crumble back on down
You give up everything you are
And even then you don't get far
They make believe that everything
Is exactly what it seems
But at least when you're at your worst
You know how to feel things 'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love Go ahead and still my heart
To make me cry again
'Cause it will never hurt
As much as it did then
We were both right
And no one had blame
But now I give up
On this endless game 'Cause who wants to be right as rain
It's better when something is wrong
I get excitement in my bones
Even though everything's a strain
When night comes and I'm on my own
You should know I chose to be alone
Who wants to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top 'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love No room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love So little to say but so much time
Despite my empty mouth the words are in my mind
Please wear the face, the one where you smile
Because you lighten up my heart when I start to cry Forgive me first love, but I'm tired
I need to get away to feel again
Try to understand why, don't get so close to change my mind
Please wipe that look out of your eyes, it's bribing me to doubt myself
Simply, it's tiring This love has dried up and stayed behind
And if I stay I'll be alive
Then choke on words I'd always hide
Excuse me first love, but we're through
I need to taste the kiss from someone new Forgive me first love, but I'm too tired
I'm bored to say the least and I, I lack desire
Forgive me first love, forgive me first love, forgive me first love
Forgive me first love forgive me, forgive me first love, forgive me first love This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the earth move and then
Hear my heart burst again For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen Let the skyfall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together Let the skyfall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall
At skyfall Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number, you can take my name
But you'll never have my heart Let the skyfall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together Let the skyfall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together
At skyfall [x2:]
(Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall) Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me
Without the security
Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand Let the skyfall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together Let the skyfall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together
At skyfall Let the sky fall
We will stand tall
At skyfall This is how the story went
I met someone by accident
It blew me away
Blew me away It was in the darkest of my days
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
And buried them away, you buried them away I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away Dropped you off at the train station
Put a kiss on top of your head
Watch you wave
And watched you wave Then I went on home to my skyscrapers
And neon lights and waiting papers
That I call home
I call that home I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away, away Woke up feeling heavy-hearted
I'm going back to where I started
The morning rain, the morning rain
And though I wish that you were here
On that same old road that brought me here
It's calling me home, It's calling me home I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away
I can't spend my whole life hiding my heart away Right under my feet there's air made of bricks
Pulls me down turns me weak for you
I find myself repeating like a broken tune
And I'm forever excusing your intentions
That I give in to my pretendings
Which forgive you each time
Without me knowing
They melt my heart to stone And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love Each and every time I turn around to leave
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
So desperately I try to link it with my head
But instead I fall back to my knees
As you tear your way right through me
I forgive you once again
Without me knowing
You've burnt my heart to stone And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love Why do you steal my hand
Whenever I'm standing my own ground
You build me up, then leave me dead I hear your words you made up
I say your name like there should be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one, in love
I'm the only one in love Fool that I am for falling in love with you
And fool that I am for thinking you loved me too You took my heart then played the part of little coquette
And my dreams just disappeared like the smoke from a cigarette Fool that I am for hoping you'd understand
And thinking you would listen to all of the things
The things I had planned But we couldn't see eye to eye
So darling
Darling
Darling this is goodbye Oh
I still care
Fool that I am
Ooh
I still care
Fool that I am You say it's all in my head
And the things I think just don't make sense
So where you been then? Don't go all coy
Don't turn it round on me like it's my fault
See I can see that look in your eyes
The one that shoots me each and every time You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her These days when I see you
You make it look like I'm see-through
Do tell me why you waste our time
When your heart ain't in it, and you're not satisfied
You know I know just how you feel
I'm starting to find myself feeling that way too When you grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her Time and time again, I play the role of fool
(Just for you)
Even in the daylight when you think that
(I don't see you)
Try to look for things I hear but our eyes never find
Though I do know how you play You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her [Adele]
Why do you love me
Do you love me...?
Why do you love me
Do you love me?
Why do you love me
Do you love me? Why do you love me...? Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me? Why do you love me?
There must be something in the water
Cause baby I'm in deeper than I knew
How do you keep me coming back for more
After all we've been through
I can't decide if I should run and hide It's above and beyond me
It's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy
It's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me... Who knows why I love you
It could be something in the air I breath
Whatever it is, I depend on it
Where does the time go?
I spend every single moment daydreaming of you
I can't describe how I feel, it feels right It's above and beyond me
It's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy
It's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me You were a shock in the dark that blew me away
And you left your mark and it never will fade
You ignited a spark, let the fires away
Are you ready, ready?
You have a place in my heart that will always be yours
You are the peak and art of my universe
Every piece and part, you were the first
I am ready, ready It's above and beyond me,
It's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you It's above and beyond me,
It's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me... Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me? You said I'm stubborn and I never give in
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that
I think you're giving out in way too much in fact
I say we've only known each other a year
You say I've known you longer my dear
You like to be so close, I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
Walking with each other,
Think we'll never match at all, but we do
But we do, but we do, but we do I thought I knew myself, somehow you know me more
I've never known this, never before
You're the first to make up whenever we argue
I don't know who I'd be if I didn't know you
You're so provocative, I'm so conservative
You're so adventurous, I'm so very cautious, combining
You think we would and we do,
But we do, but we do, but we do Favoritism ain't my thing but,
In this situation I'll be glad Favoritism ain't my thing but,
In this situation I'll be glad to make an exception You said I'm stubborn and I never give in
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that
I think you're giving out in way too much in fact
I say we've only known each other one year
You say I've known you longer my dear
You like to be so close, I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
Walking with each other,
Think we'll never match at all, but we do In the darkness of my heart is a shadow of your face
From the deepest part of my regret
I hear the words I wish I'd said
At the dawning of the day
I can't wait to see the light
Make up memories in my head
They help to fill the emptiness you've left
I can't drown in your tears
I won't face your fears
I need to fight my own
You'll never see me again oh baby in time
Let the weight take me under
I know I'll survive
You'll never see me again At the dawning of the day
I can't bare to see the light
Make up memories in my head
They help to fill the emptiness you've left
I can't drown in your tears
I won't face your fears
I need to fight my own
You'll never see me again oh baby in time
Let the weight take me under
I know I'll survive Let the floor beneath of me fall
Let the sky come crashing down
Turn all my right to wrong
But after you that goes on
You'll never see me again
I've been learning to live without you
It's taken all of my stake
But I'm stronger now You'll never see me again oh baby in time
Let the weight take me under
I know I'll survive Let the floor beneath of me fall
Let the sky come crashing down
Turn all my right to wrong
But after you that goes on
You'll never see me again
You'll never see me again
You'll never see me again I want to see your face in every kind of light
In fields of dawn and forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make What are you doing the rest of your life?
North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me I want to see your face in every kind of light
In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes
In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes
It may take a kiss or two Through all of my life
Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall of my life
All I ever will recall of my life
Is all of my life with you Wait, do you see my heart on my sleeve?
It's been there for days on end and
It's been waiting for you to open up
Yours too baby, come on now
I'm trying to tell you just how
I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally
Say that it's always been me That's made you feel the way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last
Like I'm the one for you You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me
Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me Why is it every time I think I've tried my hardest
It turns out it ain't enough
You're still not mentioning love
What am I supposed to do to make you want me properly?
I'm taking these chances and getting nowhere
And though I'm trying my hardest you go back to her
And I think that I know things may never change
I'm still hoping one day I might hear you say I make you feel the way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last
Like I'm the one for you You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me
Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me But, despite the truth that I know
I find it hard to let go and give up on you
Seems I love the things you do
Like the meaner you treat me the more eager I am
To persist with this heartbreak and running around
And I will do until I'm finding myself you And make you feel a way you've never felt before
And be all you need so that you never want more
And you'll say all of the right things without a clue
And you'll be the one for me and me the one for you I let it fall, my heart,
And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands, they're strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,
Your name When I lay with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together nothing gets better 'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name,
Your name I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Well, it felt something died
'Cause I knew that that was
The last time, the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door,
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,
Your name I set fire to the rain,
And I threw us into the flames
Well, it felt something died
'Cause I knew that, that was the last time
The last time Let it burn
Let it burn
Let it burn [Adele]
I would never lie to you unless you tell me to...
Every part of me
All my words to hold
And hold against me
Why won't you let it be? Don't you ever say my love opened up your heart
No I'm not gonna do it standing up
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby
Won't you turn off the lights Lay me down
'til the morning!
Lay me down (through the night)
Lay me down (I can fall in)
Lay me down (Won't you)
Lay me down (I can baby)
Lay me down (Someone believe me) I would never break the rules unless you tell me to
You can read my mind, be it truth or lies
Lie down beside me, why won't you let it be? Don't you ever say my love opened up your heart
No I'm not gonna do it standing up
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights Lay me down ('til the morning)
Lay me down (through the night)
Lay me down (I can fall in)
Lay me down (Won't you)
Lay me down (I can baby)
Lay me down (Someone believe me) Lay down with me
Lay down with me
Lay down with me
Lay down with me Words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights Lay me down ('til the morning)
Lay me down (through the night)
Lay me down (I can fall in)
Lay me down (Won't you)
Lay me down (I can baby)
Lay me down
Someone believe me Never been a girl who used to cry
Didn`t show emotions, don`t know why
Didn`t wanna feel the pain inside, I guess But as the years keep going by,
you came along and changed my mind
I should leave the past behind me,
I should let you find me,
supposed to stay beside me
You were supposed to guide me,
through the ups and downs,
you were always gonna be around until the end I still think we could
`cause you and me, we`re good
And I`ll tell you why this hurts, 'cause I`m sober But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has put me through
Even when I've had too much,
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough So I pour myself another drink
whenever I start to think about you
`cause I do but I really don`t want to
but sometimes my dreams just come through And when I get there,
to a place where I see you in a kitchen
I start wishing for that thing and I don`t need you,
I don`t really wanna see you
and I don`t want you to see me,
you would think that I was crazy,
you might think that I wanna be close to you
but I`d rather wanna drink some Whisky
and maybe have a little sip `o wine
`cause right now it`s the only thing that makes me forget you were mine
but right now I am sober But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has put me through
Even when I've had too much,
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough I still think we could
(I`m not drunk enough)
`cause you and me, we`re good
`cause I`m sober But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has put me through
Even when I've had too much,
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough (I still think we could)
But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has put me through
(`cause you and me we`re good)
Even when I've had too much,
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough Think I've had enough
I must my way
I've fallen off the edge to find that I've gone blind
You're leading me astray
You haunt me like a ghost
And that scares me the most
There you are the devil on my shoulder
Smiling as the flames are growing colder
How can I believer what I have?
For a little confidence I'll grab But when my hand goes out don't take it for I'm trying to make it on my own
I fell it in my bones any minute now!
This train of thought will leave the statio
My impatience will come out to play
You've turned out to be the only face I see!
Running through the empty hallways I can tell that I am not alone You spin a web in every room
You spin a web in every room
And try to break the backbone that I've grown
Will I make my own path or wander where I'm thrown
Will I make my own path or wander where I'm thrown
Or wander where I'm thrown? When we used
To say goodnight
I'd always kiss
And hold you tight
But lately
You don't seem
To care
You close the door
And leave me
Standing there
Oh, honey
That's not fair
That's it
I quit
I'm movin' on The other night
We had a date
An you showed up
Two hours late
And though your hair
Was all in place
Somebody smeared
Their lipstick
On your face
Oh, they smeared it
Every place
Ye that's it honey
I quit I'm movin' on [Chorus]
You made me want you
You made me leave you
You made me tumble
And fall
But if I
Can't have you the way
I want you
I don't want you at all Baby, I can take a lot
'Cause I love
Everything you got
Though your kisses
Fill me
So if you got
Someone else
I gotta go
Oh, that you know
Ye that's it honey
I quit I'm movin' on [Chorus] Baby
I can take a lot
'Cause I love
Everything you got
Though your kisses
Fill me
So if you got
Someone else
I gotta go
Oh, that you know
So that's it baby
I quit I'm movin' on
Ye that's it baby
I quit now
I'm movin' on Don't ask me
What you know is true
Don't have to tell you
I love your precious heart I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never tear us apart We could live
For a thousand years
But if I hurt you
I'd make wine from your tears I told you
That we could fly
'Cause we all have wings
But some of us don't know why I
I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never ever tear us apart I know sometimes you're scared of the light
But how will you ever know if you never try
There's something new inside my heart
And it grabs like a child whenever we're apart
I see your face under every sky
I find the less I look, more I find
So let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want You know sometimes that I'm scared of the dark
But I'm feeling sun babe when I'm in your arms
You said my name in the dead of glory
You hold me alright
When I'm short of falling So let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want There will be times
When we'll try to give it up
Bursting out, it seems no doubt that will almost fall apart than burn to pieces
And we'll watch them turn to dust
But without each other, nothing is easy enough So let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
'cause you're the only one I want, yeah
You're the only one
Never gonna leave you
No, I'm never gonna leave you, no Go ahead, go ahead and smash it on the floor
Take whatever is left, and take it with you out the door
See if I cry
See if I shed a single sorry tear
Can't say that it's been that great
No in fact it's been a wasted worried year [Chorus]
Everybody sees
And everyone agrees
That you and I are wrong
And it's been that way to long
Take it as it comes
And be thankful when it's done
There's so many ways to act
And there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black Let it out, let it all out
Say what's on your mind
You can kick and scream and shout and say things that are so unkind
Yeah-see if I care, see if I stand firm or if I fall
Cause in the back of my mind, and on the tip of my tongue
Is the answer to it all [Chorus] Yeah there's many shades of black [Chorus] Cause there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
Yeah there's any shades of black
There's so many shades of black
Yeah there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
And there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black Go ahead... Last night she said
Oh, baby
I feel so down
Oh, and turned me off
When I feel left out
So I
I turned around
Oh, baby
I don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking
Out that door Well, I've been in town
For just about fifteen
Whole minutes now
Oh, baby, I feel so down
And I don't know why
I keep walking for miles But the people
They don't understand
No, girlfriends
They can't understand
Your grandsons
They won't understand
On top of this
I ain't ever
Gonna understand Last night she said
Oh, baby
Don't feel so down
Oh, and turned me off
When I feel left out
So I, I turned around
Oh, baby
I'm gonna be alright
It was a great big lie
Cuz I left that night
Yeah Oh, people
They don't understand
No, girlfriends
They don't understand
In spaceships
They won't understand
And me
I ain't ever
Gonna understand Last night she said
Oh, baby
I feel so down
She had turned me off
When I feel left out
So I
I turned around
Oh, little girl
I don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking
Out that door, yeah Painting pictures with my mind
Making memories using my eyes
Filling up my heart with golden stories
Who adds some spice to the rhythm of life, oh Welcome sunrise with the morning glory
I've changed my mind
There is no simple
I thought of me, I want to see
I want to feel my heartbeat so
With the world that you feel, leave I can feel the pressure pushing onto my heart
And it's teasing me
To scratch my itch and beat my drum
So I can start to begin what's begun Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories Running riots inside my soul
Fire burning and it's lighting me up
To scratch my itch and beat my drum
So I can finish what has begun Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories Sometimes the hole you left hurts
My heart so bad, it cuts through
The deepest parts of me and fills up my mouth with the words that cry
Out, I'm still trying to stay inside Hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts Our hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts Every now and then my memories ache
With empty ideas of the ones we'd have made it
But as time goes on and my age gets older
I love the ones I know, they're enough to picture the rest 'Cause heart break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts Our hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts You know when to make me, imagine you're here
You know when to make me, imagine you're here
You know when to make me, imagine you're here
You know when to make me, imagine you're here Find yourself a girl
And settle down
Live a simple life
In a quiet town Steady as she goes
(Steady as she goes)
Steady as she goes
(Steady as she goes) So steady as she goes Your friends have shown
A kink
In the single life
You've had
Too much to think
Now you need a wife Steady as she goes

So steady as she goes
(Steady as she goes) Well here we go again
You've found yourself
A friend
That knows you well
But no matter
What you do

As though you
Tripped and fell So steady as she goes When you have completed
What you thought
You had to do
And your blood's
Depleted
To the point
Of stable glue Then you'll get along
Then you'll get along Steady as she goes
(Steady as she goes)
So steady as she goes
(Steady as she goes) Well here we go again
You've found yourself
A friend
That knows you well
But no matter
What you do
You'll always feel
As though you
Tripped and fell So steady as she goes
Steady as she goes Settle for a girl

Neither up or down
(Neither up or down)
Sell it to the crowd
(Sell it to the crowd)
That is gathered round

Neither up or down

Sell it to the crowd
(Sell it to the crowd)
That is gathered round

So steady as she goes
(Steady as she goes) Steady as she go
Are you steady now?
Steady as she goes
Are you steady now? Steady as she goes
Are you steady now?
Steady as she goes
Are you steady now? Steady as she goes I'm insane in the brain
You're not already...
Feel the pain running through my veins
Don't you piss me off, pretentious, ostentatious
Other words are spring to me
... emolicious, for the shoot posses no... And you want me to respect you
And have... for yourself
You're out of control with nobody around to help
Help, help oh oh. Chorus:
This time you're on your own
Running back to mommy hoping that she's home
But if she's not there and you're on your alone
So... you then go calling
Call it a fiasco, call it a fiasco, fiasco
... fiasco, fiasco,... fiasco
1 2 3 4.
Hustle...
Wanna try to testify in a... of happiness
Be the best, have success,
Doesn't mean you're Hollywood Feel blessed not impressed
By the glamour if you think you could. And you want me to respect you
And have... for yourself
You're out of control with nobody around to help
Help, help oh oh. Chorus:
This time you're on your own
Running about the mammy hoping that she's home
But if she's not there and you're on your alone
So... you then go calling

I'm calling, I'm calling, I'm calling it fiasco,
I'm calling, I'm calling, I'm calling it fiasco,
I'm calling, I'm calling, I'm calling it fiasco. 
I. LIFE.
When somebody loved me
Everything was beautiful
Every hour we spent together
Lives within my heart And when she was sad
I was there to dry her tears
And when she was happy so was I
When she loved me Through the summer and the fall
We had each other that was all
Just she and I together
Like it was meant to be And when she was lonely
I was there to comfort her
And I knew that she loved me So the years went by
I stayed the same
She began to drift away
I was left alone Still I waited for the day
When she'd say
I will always love you Lonely and forgotten
Never thought she'd look my way
She smiled at me and held me Just like she used to do
Like she loved me
When she loved me When somebody loved me
Everything was beautiful
Every hour we spent together
Lives within my heart When she loved me, hey Sentimentos são
Fáceis de mudar
Mesmo entre quem
Não vê que alguém
Pode ser seu par Basta um olhar
Que o outro não espera
Para assustar e até perturbar
Mesmo a bela e a fera Sentimento assim
Sempre é uma surpresa
Quando ele vem
Nada o detém
É uma chama acesa Sentimentos vêm
Para nos trazer
Novas sensações
Doces emoções
E um novo prazer E numa estação
Como a primavera
Sentimentos são
Como uma canção
Para a bela e a fera Sentimentos são
Como uma canção
Para a bela e a fera Para a bela e a fera Tale as old as time
True as it can be
Barely even friends
Then somebody bends
Unexpectedly. Just a little change
Small to say the least
Both a little scared
Neither one prepared
Beauty and the Beast Ever just the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before
Ever just as sure
As the sun will rise Tale as old as time
Tune as old as song
Bittersweet and strange
Finding you can change
Learning you were wrong Certain as the sun
Rising in the east
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast Look at this stuff, isn't it neat?
Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?
Wouldn't you think I'm the girl
The girl who has everything?
Look at this trove, treasures untold
How many wonders can one cavern hold?
Lookin' around here you'd think
Sure, she's got everything I've got gadgets and gizmos aplenty
I've got whooz-its and whatz-its galore
You want thingamabobs?
I got twenty
But who cares?
No big deal
I want more I want to be where the people are
I want to see
Want to see 'em dancing
Walking around on those
Whadd'ya call 'em? Oh, feet
Flipping your fins you don't get too far
Legs are required for jumping, dancing
Strolling along down a
What's that word again? Street Up where they walk
Up where they run
Up where they stay all day in the sun
Wandering free
Wish I could be
Part of that world What would I give
If I could live
Out of these waters?
What would I pay
To spend a day
Warm on the sand?
Betcha on land
They understand
That they don't reprimand their daughters
Bright young women
Sick of swimming
Ready to stand And I'm ready to know what the people know
Ask 'em my questions
And get some answers
What's a fire and why does it
What's the word? Burn? When's it my turn?
Wouldn't I love
Love to explore that shore above?
Out of the sea
Wish I could be
Part of that world
Out of the sea
Wish I could be
Part of your world You think I'm an ignorant savage
And you've been so many places
I guess it must be so
But still I cannot see
If the savage one is me
How can there be so much that you don't know
You don't know You think you own whatever land you land on
The Earth is just a dead thing you can claim
But I know every rock and tree and creature
Has a life, has a spirit, has a name You think the only people who are people
Are the people who look and think like you
But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger
You'll learn things you never knew, you never knew Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountains
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest
Come taste the sun sweet berries of the Earth
Come roll in all the riches all around you
And for once, never wonder what they're worth The rainstorm and the river are my brothers
The heron and the otter are my friends
And we are all connected to each other
In a circle, in a hoop that never ends How high will the sycamore grow
If you cut it down, then you'll never know
And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
For whether we are white or copper skinned
We need to sing with all the voices of the mountains
We need to paint with all the colors of the wind You can own the Earth and still
All you'll own is Earth until
You can paint with all the colors of the wind It's a small world, it's a small world
It's a small world, it's a small world It's a world of laughter, a world of tears
It's a world of hope and a world of fears
There's so much that we share, that it's time we're aware
It's a small world after all (Everybody now) it's a small world after all, it's a small world after all
(Everybody now) it's a small world after all, it's a small, small, small, small world There is just one moon and one golden sun
And a smile means friendship to everyone
Though the mountains be wide and the oceans are wide
It's a small world after all (Come on, come on) (Everybody now) it's a small world after all (can you hear me now) it's a small world after all
(Everybody now) it's a small world after all, it's a small, small, small, small world It's a small world after all, no matter if you're big or small
Come on everybody let's bounce to this
Let's play some love with a little twist
It's a small world, it's a small world It's a world of laughter, a world of tears
It's a world of hope and a world of fears
There's so much that we share, that it's time we're aware
It's a small world after all, it's a small world (Everybody now) it's a small world after all, it's a small world after all
(Everybody now) it's a small world after all, it's a small, small, small, small world (can you hear me now?) It's a small world after all (come on, come on)
It's a small, small, small, small world (come on, come on)
It's a small world, after all (can you hear me now?) It's a small world after all (come on, come on)
It's a small world after all
It's a small, small, small, small world (pretty small eh) It's a small world after all, it's a small world after all
It's a small world after all, it's a small, small, small, small world
It's a small world after all, it's a small world after all
It's a small world after all, it's a small, small, small, small world A dream is a wish your heart makes
When you're fast asleep
In dreams you will loose your heartache
Whatever you wish for, you keep Have faith in your dreams and someday
Your rainbow will come smiling through
No matter how your heart is grieving
If you keep on believing
The dream that you wish will come true Oh, that clock!
Oh, killjoy
I hear you, come on, get up you say
Time to start another day
Even he orders me around
Well, there's one thing
They can't order me to stop dreaming
And perhaps someday
The dreams that I wish will come true No matter how your heart is grieving
If you keep on believing
The dream that you wish will come true I've been staring at the edge of the water
Long as I can remember
Never really knowing why
I wish I could be the perfect daughter
But I come back to the water
No matter how hard I try Every turn I take
Every trail I track
Every path I make
Every road leads back to the place I know
Where I cannot go
Where I long to be See the line where the sky meets the sea
It calls me
And no one knows how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know
If I go there's just no telling how far I'll go I know everybody on this island
Seems so happy on this island
Everything is by design
I know everybody on this island
Has a role on this island
So maybe I can roll with mine I can lead with pride
I can make us strong
I'll be satisfied if I play along
But the voice inside sings a different song
What is wrong with me See the light as it shines on the sea
It's blinding
But no one knows how deep it goes
And it seems like it's calling out to me
So come find me
And let me know
What's beyond that line
Will I cross that line The line where the sky meets the sea
It calls me
And no one knows how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know
How far I'll go Look at me
I will never pass for a perfect bride
Or a perfect daughter
Can it be
I'm not meant to play this part?
Now I see
That if I were truly to be myself
I would break my fam'ly's heart Who is that girl I see
Staring straight
Back at me?
Why is my reflection someone
I don't know?
Somehow I cannot hide
Who I am
Though I've tried
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside?
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside? When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires
Will come to you
If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind
She brings to those to love
The sweet fulfillment of
Their secret longing
Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true Belle:
There's something sweet and almost kind
But he was mean and he was coarse and unrefined
And now he's dear and so unsure
I wonder why I didn't see it there before Beast:
She glanced this way, I thought I saw
And when we touched she didn't shudder at my paw
No it can't be, I'll just ignore
But then she's never looked at me that way before Belle:
New and a bit alarming
Who'd have ever thought that this could be?
True that he's no Prince Charming
But there's something in him that I simply didn't see Lumiere:
Well, who'd have thought? Mrs Potts:
Well, bless my soul Cogsworth:
Well, who'd have known? Mrs Potts:
Well, who indeed? Lumiere:
And who'd have guessed they'd come together on their own? Mrs Potts:
It's so peculiar,
Wait and see. All three:
We'll wait and see
A few days more
There may be something there that wasn't there before Cogsworth:
Well here's a thought, perhaps there's something there that wasn't there before Chip:
What mama? Mrs Potts:
There may be something there that wasn't there before If there's a prize for rotten judgment
I guess I've already won that
No man is worth the aggravation
That's ancient history, been there, done that
Who d'you think you're kidding
He's the earth and heaven to you
Try to keep it hidden
Honey we can see right through you (Oh no)
Girl, you can't conceal it
We know how you're feeling
Who you thinking of?
No chance, no way, I won't say it, no, no
You swoon, you sigh, why deny it, oh, oh
It's too cliché, I won't say I'm in love
I thought my heart had learned its lesson
It feels so good when you start out
My head is screaming "get a grip, girl"
"Unless you're dying to cry your heart out"
Girl, you can't deny it
Who you are and how you're feeling
Baby we're not buying
Hon we saw you hit the ceiling
Face it like a grown-up
When you gonna own up that you got, got, got it bad?
No chance, no way, I won't say it, no no
Give up, give in, check the grin, you're in love
This scene won't play, I won't say I'm in love
We'll do it until you admit you're in love
You're way off base, I won't say it
Get off my case, I won't say it
Girl don't be proud, it's okay you're in love
At least out loud I won't say I'm in love Tale as old as time
True as it can be
Barely even friends

Beauty and the Beast Little town
It's a quiet village
Every day
Like the one before
Little town
Full of little people
Waking up to say Bonjour
Bonjour
Bonjour Bonjour Bonjour There goes the baker with his tray, like always
The same old bread and rolls to sell
Every morning just the same
Since the morning that we came
To this poor provincial town
Good Morning, Belle
'Morning, Monsieur
Where are you off to
The bookshop. I just finished the most wonderful story
about a beanstalk and an ogre and a
That's nice. Marie, the baguettes hurry up Look there she goes that girl is strange, no question
Dazed and distracted, can't you tell
Never part of any crowd
'Cause her head's up on some cloud
No denying she's a funny girl that Belle Bonjour
Good day
How is your family Bonjour
Good day
How is your wife I need six eggs
That's too expensive There must be more than this provincial life Ah, Belle
Good Morning. I've come to return the book I borrowed
Finished already
Oh, I couldn't put it down. Have you got anything new
Ha Ha! Not since yesterday
That's all right. I'll borrow, this one
That one? But you've read it twice
Well, it's my favorite! Far off places, daring sword fights
magic spells, a prince in disguise
If you like it all that much, it's yours
But sir
I insist
Well, thank you. Thank you very much Look there she goes that girl is so peculiar
I wonder if she's feeling well
With a dreamy far-off look
And her nose stuck in a book
What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle Oh, isn't this amazing?
It's my favorite part because you'll see
Here's where she meets Prince Charming
But she won't discover that it's him 'til chapter three Now it's no wonder that her name means "beauty"
Her looks have got no parallel
But behind that fair facade
I'm afraid she's rather odd
Very diff'rent from the rest of us
She's nothing like the rest of us
Yes, diff'rent from the rest of us is Belle Wow! You didn't miss a shot, Gaston, You're the greatest
hunter in the whole world!
I know.
No beast alive stands a chance against you. Ha ha ha and
no girl, for that matter.
It's true, LeFou. And I've got my sights set on that one
Hmm the inventor's daughter
She's the one - the lucky girl I'm going to marry
But she's
The most beautiful girl in town.
I know, but
That makes her the best. And don't I deserve the best
Well, of course! I mean you do, but Right from the moment when I met her, saw her
I said she's gorgeous and I fell
Here in town there's only she
Who is beautiful as me
So I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle Look there he goes
Isn't he dreamy
Monsieur Gaston
Oh he's so cute
Be still my heart
I'm hardly breathing
He's such a tall, dark, strong and handsome brute Bonjour
Pardon
Good day
Mais oui
You call this bacon
What lovely grapes
Some cheese
Ten yards
One pound
'Scuse me
I'll get the knife
Please let me through
This bread
Those fish
It's stale
They smell
Madame's mistaken There must be more than this provincial life
Just watch, I'm going to make Belle my wife Look there she goes a girl who's strange but special
A most peculiar mademoiselle
It's a pity and a sin
She doesn't quite fit in
'Cause she really is a funny girl
A beauty but a funny girl
She really is a funny girl
That Belle Master, I don't think you quite realize what you got here!
So, why don't you just ruminate,
Whilst I illuminate the possibilities! Well, Ali Baba had them forty thieves,
Scheherazade had a thousand tales.
But master you're in luck, 'cause up your sleeves
You've got a brand of magic never fails You've got some power in your corner now!
Some heavy ammunition in your camp!
You got some punch, pizzaz, yahoo and how...
See, all you gotta do is rub that lamp, and I'll say: Chorus:
"Mr. Aladdin, sir, what will your pleasure be?
Let me take your order, jot it down?"
You ain't never had friend like me Life is your restaurant and I'm your maitre'd
Come on whisper what it is you want;
You ain't never had friend like me! Yes sir, we pride ourselves on service.
You're the boss, the king, the shah.
Say what you wish; it's yours, true dish.
How 'bout a little more baklava? Have some of column A try All of column B,
I'm in the mood to help you, dude.
You ain't never had friend like me Oh my. No no. My my my.
Can your friends do this?
Can your friends do that?
Can your friends pull this
Out their little hat?
Can your friends go poof?
Well looky here!
Can your friends go abracadabra, let her rip,
And then make the sucker disappear? So don't just sit there slack-jawed, buggy-eyed,
I'm here to answer all your midnight prayers,
You've got me bona fide certified;
You've got a genie for charge d'affaires. I've got a powerful urge to help you out,
So what you wish, I really wanna know?
You've got a list that's three miles long, no doubt,
Well all you've gotta do is rub like so, and oh ­- Mr. Aladdin, sir, have a wish or two or three.
I'm on the job you big nabob!
You ain't never had a friend, never had a friend,
You ain't never had a friend, never had a friend,
You ain't never had a friend like me.
You ain't never had a friend like me The seaweed is always greener
In somebody else's lake
You dream about going up there
But that is a big mistake
Just look at the world around you
Right here on the ocean floor
Such wonderful things surround you
What more is you lookin' for? Under the sea
Under the sea
Darling it's better
Down where it's wetter
Take it from me
Up on the shore they work all day
Out in the sun they slave away
While we devotin'
Full time to floatin'
Under the sea Down here all the fish is happy
As off through the waves they roll
The fish on the land ain't happy
They sad 'cause they in their bowl
But fish in the bowl is lucky
They in for a worser fate
One day when the boss get hungry
Guess who's gon' be on the plate? Under the sea
Under the sea
Nobody beat us
Fry us and eat us
In fricassee
We what the land folks loves to cook
Under the sea we off the hook
We got no troubles
Life is the bubbles
Under the sea (Under the sea)
Under the sea (Under the sea) Since life is sweet here
We got the beat here
Naturally (Naturally)
Even the sturgeon an' the ray
They get the urge 'n' start to play
We got the spirit
You got to hear it
Under the sea The newt play the flute
The carp play the harp
The plaice play the bass
And they soundin' sharp
The bass play the brass
The chub play the tub
The fluke is the duke of soul
(Yeah)
The ray he can play
The lings on the strings
The trout rockin' out
The blackfish she sings
The smelt and the sprat
They know where it's at
An' oh that blowfish blow Yeah, under the sea (Under the sea)
Under the sea (Under the sea)
When the sardine
Begin the beguine
It's music to me (It's music to me)
What do they got? A lot of sand
We got a hot crustacean band
Each little clam here
Know how to jam here
Under the sea
Each little slug here
Cuttin' a rug here
Under the sea
Each little snail here
Know how to wail here
That's why it's hotter
Under the water
Ya we in luck here
Down in the muck here
Under the sea [Gramma Tala:]
I know a girl from an island
She stands apart from the crowd
She loves the sea and her people
She makes her whole family proud
Sometimes the world seems against you
The journey may leave a scar
But scars can heal and reveal just
Where you are The people you love will change you
The things you have learned will guide you
And nothing on earth can silence
The quiet voice still inside you
And when that voice starts to whisper
Moana you've come so far
Moana listen
Do you know who you are? [Moana:]
Who am I?
I am a girl who loves my island
I'm the girl who loves the sea
It calls me
I am the daughter of the village chief
We are descended from voyagers
Who found their way across the world
They call me
I've delivered us to where we are
I have journeyed farther
I am everything I've learned and more
Still it calls me
And the call isn't out there at all, it's inside me
It's like the tide; always falling and rising
I will carry you here in my heart you'll remind me
That come what may
I know the way
I am Moana! The only way to get what you want is to become a human yourself
Can you do that? My dear, sweet child, that's what I do
It's what I live for
To help unfortunate merfolk like yourself
Poor souls with no one else to turn to I admit that in the past I've been a nasty
They weren't kidding when they called me, well, a witch
But you'll find that nowadays
I've mended all my ways
Repented, seen the light, and made a switch
To this
And I fortunately know a little magic
It's a talent that I always have possessed
And dear lady, please don't laugh
I use it on behalf
Of the miserable, the lonely, and depressed (Pathetic) Poor unfortunate souls
In pain, in need
This one longing to be thinner
That one wants to get the girl
And do I help them?
Yes, indeed
Those poor unfortunate souls
So sad, so true
They come flocking to my cauldron
Crying, "Spells, Ursula, please!"
And I help them
Yes I do Now it's happened once or twice
Someone couldn't pay the price
And I'm afraid I had to rake 'em 'cross the coals
Yes I've had the odd complaint
But on the whole I've been a saint
To those poor unfortunate souls Have we got a deal?
If I become human, I'll never be with my father or sisters again
But you'll have your man
Life's full of tough choices, isn't it?
Oh, and there is one more thing
We haven't discussed the subject of payment
But I don't have-
I'm not asking much, just a token really, a trifle
What I want from you is your voice
But without my voice, how can I-
You'll have your looks, your pretty face
And don't underestimate the importance of body language, ha! The men up there don't like a lot of blabber
They think a girl who gossips is a bore
Yet on land it's much preferred for ladies not to say a word
And after all dear, what is idle babble for?
Come on, they're not all that impressed with conversation
True gentlemen avoid it when they can
But they dote and swoon and fawn
On a lady who's withdrawn
It's she who holds her tongue who gets a man Come on you poor unfortunate soul
Go ahead
Make your choice
I'm a very busy woman and I haven't got all day
It won't cost much
Just your voice!
You poor unfortunate soul
It's sad but true
If you want to cross the bridge, my sweet
You've got the pay the toll
Take a gulp and take a breath
And go ahead and sign the scroll
Flotsam, Jetsam, now I've got her, boys
The boss is on a roll
This poor unfortunate soul Beluga sevruga
Come winds of the Caspian Sea
Larengix glaucitis
Et max laryngitis
La voce to me Now, sing
Aa-aa-aah, a-aa-aah
Keep singing!
Aa-aa-aah, a-aa-aah (Spoken) Mama, I don't have time for dancing
(Sung) That's just gonna have to wait a while
Ain't got time for messing around
And it's not my style This old town can slow you down
People taking the easy way
But I know exactly where I'm going
I'm getting closer and closer everyday And I'm almost there
I'm almost there
People 'round here think I'm crazy
But I don't care Trials and tribulations
I've had my share
But there ain't nothing gonna stop me now
Cause I'm almost there I remember daddy told me
"Fairy tales can come true
But you gotta make it happen
It all depends on you" So I work real hard each and everyday
Now things for sure are going my way
Just doing what I do
Look out boys I'm coming through And I'm almost there
I'm almost there
People gonna come here from everywhere
And I'm almost there I'm almost there There's been trials and tribulations
You know I've had my share
But I've climbed a mountain, I've crossed a river
And I'm almost there I'm almost there I'm almost there I know you
I walked with you
Once Upon a dream
I know you That gleam in your eyes
Is so familiar a gleam
Yet I know it's true
That visions are seldom what they seem But if I know you
I know what you do
You'll love me at once
The way you did once upon a dream La da la da la ahahahahah
But if I know you
I know what you do
You'll love me at once The way you did once upon a dream
I know you
I walked with you
Once Upon a dream I know you
That gleam in your eyes
Is so familiar a gleam
Yet I know it's true That visions are seldom what they seem
But if I know you
I know what you do
You'll love me at once The way you did once upon a dream The King and his men
stole the queen from her bed,
and bound her in her bones.
The seas be ours, and by the powers;
where we will, we'll roam. Yo ho, all hands,
hoist the colors high.
Heave ho, thieves and beggars;
never shall we die. Now, some have died and some are alive
and others sail on the sea.
With the keys to the cage
and the devil to pay,
we lay to the fiddler's green. Yo ho haul together,
hoist the colors high.
Heave ho, thieves and beggars;
never shall we die. The bell has been raised
from its watery grave,
hear its sepulchral tone.
A call to all; pay heed the squall,
and turn your sails to home. Yo ho, haul together,
hoist the colors high.
Heave ho, thieves and beggars;
never shall we die. Yo ho, haul together,
hoist the colors high.
Heave ho, thieves and beggars;
never shall we die. Yo ho, haul together,
hoist the colors high.
Heave ho, thieves and beggars;
never shall we die. The king and his men
stole the queen from her bed,
and bound her in her bones.
The seas be ours, and by the powers;
where we will; we'll roam. So many times out there
I've watched a happy pair of lovers walking in the night
They had a kind of glow around them
It almost looked like heaven's light I knew I'd never know that warm and loving glow
Though I might wish with all my might
No face as hideous as my face
Was ever meant for heaven's light But suddenly an angel has smiled at me
And kissed my cheek without a trace of fright I dare to dream that she might even care for me
And as I ring these bells tonight
My cold dark tower seems so bright
I swear it must be Heaven's light Confiteor deo omnipotenti
(I confess to God almighty)
Beatae Mariae semper virgini
(To blessed Mary ever virgin)
Beato Michaeli archangelo
(To the blessed Archangel Michael)
Sanctis apostolis omnibus sanctis
(To the Holy Apostles, to all the saints) Beata Maria, you know I am a righteous man
Of my virtue I am justly proud
Et tibit Pater
(And to you, Father) Beata Maria, you know I'm so much purer than
The common, vulgar, weak, licentious crowd
Quia peccavi nimis
(That I have sinned) Then tell me, Maria, why I see her dancing there?
Why her smold'ring eyes still scorch my soul
Cogitatione
(In thought) I feel her, I see her, the sun caught in her raven hair
Is blazing in me out of all control
Verbo et opere
(In word and deed) Like fire, Hellfire
This fire in my skin
This burning desire
Is turning me to sin
It's not my fault Mea culpa
(Through my fault)
I'm not to blame
Mea culpa
(Through my fault) It is the gypsy girl
The witch who sent this flame
Mea maxima culpa
(Through my most grievous fault)
It's not my fault
Mea culpa
(Through my fault) If in God's plan
Mea culpa
(Through my fault)
He made the devil so much
Stronger than a man
Mea maxima culpa
(Through my most grievous fault) Protect me, Maria
Don't let this siren cast her spell
Don't let her fire sear my flesh and bone
Destroy Esmeralda
And let her taste the fires of hell
Or else let her be mine and mine alone Minister Frollo, the gypsy has escaped
What? No longer in the cathedral, she's gone
But how? Never mind, get out, you idiot
I'll find her, I'll find her if I have to burn down all of Paris Hellfire, dark fire
Now gypsy, it's your turn
Choose me or your pyre
Be mine or you will burn Kyrie Eleison
(Lord, have mercy)
God, have mercy on her
Kyrie Eleison
(Lord, have mercy) God, have mercy on me
Kyrie Eleison
(Lord, have mercy)
But she will be mine
Or she will burn I'm gonna be a mighty king
So enemies beware!
Well, I've never seen a king of beasts
With quite so little hair
I'm gonna be the mane event
Like no king was before I'm brushing up on looking down
I'm working on my ROAR
Thus far, a rather uninspiring thing
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!
(You've rather a long way to go, young master
if you think) No one saying do this
(Now when I said that, I)
No one saying be there
(What I meant was)
No one saying stop that
(Look, what you don't realize) No one saying see here
(Now see here!)
Free to run around all day
(Well, that's definitely out)
Free to do it all my way!
I think it's time that you and I Arranged a heart to heart
Kings don't need advice
From little hornbills for a start
If this is where the monarchy is headed
Count me out!
Out of service, out of Africa I wouldn't hang about
This child is getting wildly out of wing
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!
Everybody look left
Everybody look right
Everywhere you look I'm Standing in spotlight!
Not yet!
Let every creature go for broke and sing
Let's hear it in the herd and on the wing
It's gonna be King Simba's finest fling
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!
Oh, I just can't wait to be king! A word's just a word
'Til you mean what you say
And love isn't love
'Til you give it away We've all got a gift
Yeah, something to give
To make a change Send it on, on and on
Just one hand can heal another
Be a part, reach a heart
Just one spark starts a fire With one little action
The chain reaction will never stop
Make it strong
Shine a light, and send it on Just smile, and the world
Will smile along with you
That small act of love
Is meant for one who become two If we take the chances
To change circumstances
Imagine all we can do If we send it on, on and on
Just one hand can heal another
Be a part, reach a heart
Just one spark starts a fire With one little action
The chain reaction will never stop
Make it strong
Shine a light, and send it on
Send it on, ooh, send it on There's power in all
Of the choices we make
So I'm starting now
There's not a moment to waste A word's just word
'Til you mean what you say
And love isn't love
'Til you give it away Send it on, on and on
Just one hand can heal another
Be a part, reach a heart
Just one spark starts a fire With one little action
The chain reaction will never stop

Shine a light, and send it on Every time she'd find a minute
That's the time that they begin it
Cinderelly, Cinderelly (Cinderella!) Cinderelly, Cinderelly
Night and day it's Cinderelly
Make the fire, fix the breakfast
Wash the dishes, do the mopping
And the sweeping and the dusting
They always keep her hopping
She goes around in circles till she's very, very dizzy
Still they holler "Keep a-busy, Cinderelly!" We can do it, we can do it
We can help our Cinderelly
We can make her dress so pretty
There's nothing to it, really
We'll tie a sash around it
Put a ribbon through it
When dancing at the ball she'll be more beautiful than all
In the lovely dress we'll make for Cinderelly! Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry
Gonna help our Cinderelly
Got no time to dilly-dally
We gotta get a-goin'
I'll cut it with these scissors!
And I can do the sewing!
Leave the sewing to the women
You go get some trimmin'
And we'll make a lovely dress for Cinderelly, whoo! We'll make a lovely dress for Cinderelly! Morning in Paris, the city awakes
To the bells of Notre Dame
The fisherman fishes, the bakerman bakes
To the bells of Notre Dame
To the big bells as loud as the thunder
To the little bells soft as a psalm
And some say the soul of the city is
The toll of the bells
The bells of Notre Dame Dark was the night when our tale was begun
On the docks near Notre Dame Four frightened gypsies slid silently under
The docks near Notre Dame But a trap had been laid for the gypsies
And they gazed up in fear and alarm
At a figure whose clutches
Were iron as much as the bells The bells of Notre Dame (Kyrie Eleison)
Judge Claude Frollo longed
To purge the world
Of vice and sin
(Kyrie Eleison)
And he saw corruption
Ev'rywhere
Except within Dies irae, dies illa
(Dies irae, dies illa)
Dies irae, dies illa
(Dies irae, dies illa)
Solvet saeclum in favilla
Teste David cum sibylla
Quantus tremor est futurus
Quando Judex est venturus See there the innocent blood you have spilt
On the steps of Notre Dame Now you would add this child's blood to your guilt
On the steps of Notre Dame You can lie to yourself and your minions
You can claim that you haven't a qualm
But you never can run from
Nor hide what you've done from the eyes
The very eyes of Notre Dame (Kyrie Eleison)
And for one time in his live
Of power and control
(Kyrie Eleison)
Frollo felt a twinge of fear
For his immortal soul Just so he's kept locked away
Where no one else can see Even this foul creature may
Yet prove one day to be
Of use to me Now here is a riddle to guess if you can
Sing the bells of Notre Dame
Who is the monster and who is the man Sing the bells, bells, bells, bells
Bells, bells, bells, bells
Bells of Notre Dame I can show you the world
Shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me, princess, now when did
You last let your heart decide? I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But when I'm way up here, it's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with you
Now I'm in a whole new world with you Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky A whole new world
Don't you dare close your eyes
A hundred thousand things to see
(Hold your breath, it gets better) I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far
I can't go back
To where I used to be A whole new world
Every turn a surprise
With new horizons to pursue
Every moment red-letter I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you A whole new world
That's where we'll be
A thrilling chase
A wondrous place
For you and me Somewhere out there,
Beneath the pale moonlight,
Someone's thinking of me,
And loving me tonight. Somewhere out there,
Someone's saying a prayer,
That we'll find one another,
In that big somewhere out there. And even though I know how very far apart we are,
It helps to think we might be wishing on the same bright star,
And when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby,
It helps to think we're sleeping underneath the same big sky! Somewhere out there,
If love can see us through,
Then we'll be together,
Somewhere out there,
Out where dreams
Come true... There you see her
Sitting there across the way
She don't got a lot to say
But there's something about her
And you don't know why
But you're dying to try
You wanna kiss the girl Yes, you want her
Look at her, you know you do
Possible she wants you too
There is one way to ask her
It don't take a word
Not a single word
Go on and kiss the girl Sing with me now
Sha la la la la la
My oh my
Look like the boy too shy
Ain't gonna kiss the girl
Sha la la la la la
Ain't that sad?
Ain't it a shame?
Too bad, he gonna miss the girl Now's your moment
Floating in a blue lagoon
Boy, you better do it soon
No time will be better
She don't say a word
And she won't say a word
Until you kiss the girl Sha la la la la la
Don't be scared
You got the mood prepared
Go on and kiss the girl
Sha la la la la la
Don't stop now
Don't try to hide it how
You want to kiss the girl

Float along
And listen to the song

The music play

You wanna kiss the girl
You've gotta kiss the girl
Go on and kiss the girl Zip-a-dee-doo-dah, zip-a-dee-ay

Herc was on a roll
Person of the week in every Greek opinion poll
What a pro!
Herc could stop a show
Point him at a monster and you're talking S.R.O. He was a no one
A zero, zero
Now he a hot shot
He's a hero
He was a kid with his act down pat
From zero to hero in no time flat
Zero to hero, just like that! When he smiled the girls went wild
With oohs and ahhs
And they slapped his face on ev'ry vase
(On every vahse) From appearance fees and royalties
Our Herc had cash to burn
Now nouveau riche and famous
He could tell you what's a Grecian "earn"! Say "Amen"
There he goes again
Sweet and undefeated
And an awesome 10 for 10
Folks lined up
Just to watch him flex
And this perfect package packed a pair of pretty pecs Hercie, he comes, he sees, he conquers
Honey, the crowds were going bonkers
He showed the moxie, brains, and spunk
From zero to hero
A major hunk
Zero to hero
And who'd have thunk? Who put the "glad" in "gladiator"?
Hercules!
Whose daring deeds are great theater?
Hercules!
Is he bold?
No one braver!
Is he sweet?
Our favorite flavor! Hercules, Hercules
Hercules, Hercules
Hercules, Hercules Bless my soul
Herc was on a roll
Undefeated
Riding high
And the nicest guy
Not conceited He was a nothin'
A zero, zero
Now he's a hot-shot
He's our hero
He hit the heights at breakneck speed! From zero to hero
Herc is a hero
Now he's a hero Yes indeed! Tale as old as time
True as it can be
Barely even friends
Then somebody bends
Unexpectedly. Just a little change
Small to say the least
Both a little scared
Neither one prepared
Beauty and the Beast Ever just the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before
Ever just as sure
As the sun will rise Tale as old as time
Tune as old as song
Bittersweet and strange
Finding you can change
Learning you were wrong Certain as the sun
Rising in the east
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast Think of a wonderful thought
Any merry little thought
Think of Christmas, think of snow
Think of sleigh bells off you go
Like reindeer in the sky You can fly
You can fly
You can fly Think of the happiest things
It's the same as having wings
Take the path that moonbeams make
If the moon is still awake
You'll see him wink his eye You can fly
You can fly
You can fly Up you go with a height and ho
To the stars beyond the blue
There's a Never Land waiting for you
Where all your happy dreams come true
Every dream that you dream will come true When there's a smile in your heart
There's no better time to start
Think of all the joy you'll find
When you leave the world behind
And bid your cares goodbye You can fly
You can fly
You can fly
You can fly
You can fly When there's a smile in your heart
There's no better time to start
Think of all the joy you'll find
When you leave the world behind
And bid your cares goodbye You can fly
You can fly
You can fly
You can fly
You can fly I've been standing at the edge of the water
Long as I can remember
Never really knowing why
I wish I could be the perfect daughter
But I come back to the water
No matter how hard I try Every turn I take
Every trail I track
Every path I make
Every road leads back to the place I know
Where I cannot go
Where I long to be See the light where the sky meets the sea
It calls me
No one knows how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know
If I go there's just no telling how far I'll go I know everybody on this island
Seems so happy on this island
Everything is by design
I know everybody on this island
Has a role on this island
So maybe I can roll with mine I can lead with pride
I can make us strong
I'll be satisfied if I play along
But the voice inside sings a different song
What is wrong with me See the light as it shines on the sea
It's blinding
But no one knows how deep it goes
And it seems like it's calling out to me
So come find me
And let me know
What's beyond that line
Will I cross that line See the light where the sky meets the sea
It calls me
And no one knows how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know
How far I'll go Well Tamatoa hasn't always been this glam
I was a drab little crab once
Now I know I can be happy as a clam
Because I'm beautiful baby Did your granny say listen to your heart?
Be who you are on the inside?
I need three words to tear her argument apart: your granny lied I'd rather be shiny
Like a treasure from a sunken pirate wreck
Scrub the deck and make it look shiny
I will sparkle like a wealthy woman's neck
Just a sec, don't ya know
Fish are dumb, dumb, dumb
They chase anything that glitters, beginners
Oh and here they come, come, come to the brightest thing that glitters
Mmm fish dinners
I just love free food (free food) and you look like sea food (sea food) Well, well, well
Little Maui's havin' trouble with his look
You little semi, demi, mini god
Ouch what a terrible performance get the hook
Get it?
You don't swing it like you used to, man
Yet I have to give you credit from my start
And your tattoos on the outside
For just like you I made myself a work of art
I'll never hide
I can't I'm too shiny
Watch me dazzle like a diamond in the rough
Strut my stuff, my stuff is so shiny
Send your armies but they'll never be enough
My shell's too tough, Maui man
You can try, try, try but you can't expect a demigod to beat a decapod
Look it up
You will die, die, die now it's time for me to take apart your achin' heart Far from the ones who abandoned you
Chasin' the love of the humans who made you feel wanted
You tried to be tough but your armor's just not hard enough
Maui, now it's time to kick your heiney
Ever seen someone so shiny Soak it in 'cause it's the last you'll ever see
C'est la vie, mon ami
I'm so shiny
Now I'll eat you so prepare your final plea just for me
You'll never be quite as shiny
You wish you were nice and shiny What I love most about rivers is
You can't step in the same river twice
The water's always changing, always flowing But people, I guess, can't live like that
We all must pay a price
To be safe, we lose our chance of ever knowing What's around the river bend
Waiting just around the river bend I look once more just around the river bend
Beyond the shore where the gulls fly free
Don't know what for what I dream the day might send
Just around the river bend for me, coming for me I feel it there beyond those trees
Or right behind these waterfalls
Can I ignore that sound of distant drumming? For a handsome sturdy husband who builds handsome sturdy walls
And never dreams that something might be coming? Just around the river bend
Just around the river bend I look once more just around the river bend
Beyond the shore somewhere past the sea
Don't know what for why do all my dreams extend
Just around the river bend, just around the river bend Should I choose the smoothest course
Steady as the beating drum? Should I marry Kocoum?
Is all my dreaming at an end?
Or do you still wait for me, dream giver
Just around the river bend? In every job that must be done
There is an element of fun
You find the fun and snap!
The job's a game And every task you undertake
Becomes a piece of cake
A lark! A spree! It's very clear to see that A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
The medicine go down, the medicine go down
Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
In a most delightful way A robin feathering his nest has very little time to rest
While gathering his bits of twine and twig
Though quite intent in his pursuit
He has a merry tune to toot
He knows a song will move the job along For a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
The medicine go down, the medicine go down
Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
In a most delightful way The honey bee that fetch the nectar from the flowers to the comb
Never tired of ever buzzing to and fro
Because they take a little nip from every flower that they sip
And hence (And hence)
They find (They find)
Their task is not a grind Ah, ah, ah! Ma chere Mademoiselle, it is with deepest pride
and greatest pleasure that we welcome you tonight,

for a servant who's not serving

But the fire is so delightful

Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow When we finally kiss goodnight
How I hate going out in the storm
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm The fire is slowly dying
And my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow When we finally kiss goodnight
How I hate going out in the storm
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm The fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow As long as you love me so

Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo Yes, salagadoola means
Mechicka booleroo
But the thing mabob that does the job
Is bibbidi-bobbidi-boo I got myself a notion
And one I know that you'll understand
To set the world in motion by reaching out for each other's hand Maybe we'll discover
What we shoulda known all along
One way or another, together's where we both belong If we listen to each other's heart
We'll find we're never too far apart
And maybe love is a reason why
For the first time ever, we're seein' it eye to eye If a wall should come between us
Too high to climb, too hard to break through
I know that love'll lead us
And find a way to bring me to you So don't be in a hurry
Think before you count us out
You don't have to worry
I won't ever let you drown
(Nothing's gonna stop us now) If we listen to each other's heart
We'll find we're never too far apart
And maybe love is a reason why
For the first time ever, we're seein' it eye to eye Love is why we're seein' it eye to eye
(Yes, we are seein' it eye to eye)
Seein' it eye to
(Love is why we're seein' it)
I think we're seein' it eye to eye
(eye to eye)
eye to
We're seein' it eye to eye
(eye to eye!) If you're ever lonely, then stop!
You don't have to be
After all, it's only a beat away from you to me
(Take a look inside and see) If we listen to each other's heart
We'll find we're never too far apart
And maybe love is a reason why
For the first time ever, we're seein' it eye to eye Seein' it eye to
Seein' it eye to eye
We're seein' it eye to eye, baby
For the first time
For the first time eye to eye

Cruella De Vil
If she doesn't scare you
No evil thing will
To see her is to
Take a sudden chill
Cruella, Cruella
She's like a spider waiting
For the kill
Look out for Cruella De Vil At first you think
Cruella is the devil
But after time has worn
Away the shock
You come to realize
You've seen her kind of eyes
Watching you from underneath
A rock! This vampire bat
This inhuman beast
She ought to be locked up
And never released
The world was such
A wholesome place until
Cruella, Cruella De Vil Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries and your strife
I mean the bare necessities
Old Mother Nature's recipes
That brings the bare necessities of life Wherever I wander, wherever I roam
I couldn't be fonder of my big home
The bees are buzzin' in the tree
To make some honey just for me
When you look under the rocks and plants
And take a glance at the fancy ants
Then maybe try a few The bare necessities of life will come to you
They'll come to you! Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries and your strife
I mean the bare necessities
That's why a bear can rest at ease
With just the bare necessities of life Now when you pick a pawpaw
Or a prickly pear
And you prick a raw paw
Well next time beware
Don't pick the prickly pear by the paw
When you pick a pear
Try to use the claw
But you don't need to use the claw
When you pick a pear of the big pawpaw
Have I given you a clue? The bare necessities of life will come to you
They'll come to you! Oh man this is really living
So just try and relax, yeah cool it
Fall apart in my backyard
'Cause let me tell you something little britches
If you act like that bee acts, uh uh
You're working too hard And don't spend your time lookin' around
For something you want that can't be found
When you find out you can live without it
And go along not thinkin' about it
I'll tell you something true The bare necessities of life will come to you Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries and your strife
I mean the bare necessities
That's why a bear can rest at ease
With just the bare necessities of life
With just the bare necessities of life I see what's happening yeah
You're face to face with greatness and it's strange
You don't even know how you feel
It's adorable!
Well, it's nice to see that humans never change
Open your eyes, let's begin
Yes, it's really me
It's Maui, breathe it in
I know its a lot; the hair, the bod
When you're staring at a demigod What can I say except you're welcome
For the tides, the sun, the sky
Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome
I'm just an ordinary demi-guy Hey!
What has two thumbs and pulled up the sky
When you were waddling yay high
This guy!
When the nights got cold
Who stole you fire from down below
You're lookin' at him, yo
Oh!
Also I lassoed the sun
(You're welcome)
To stretch your days and bring you fun
Also I harnessed the breeze
(You're welcome!)
To fill your sails and shake your trees So what can I say except you're welcome
For the islands I pulled from the sea
There's no need to pray, it's okay, you're welcome
Ha! I guess it's just my way of being me
You're welcome!
You're welcome! Well, come to think of it
Kid, honestly I could go on and on
I could explain every natural phenomenon
The tide? The grass? The ground?
Oh, that was Maui just messin' around
I killed an eel, I buried its guts
Sprouted a tree, now you've got coconuts
What's the lesson? What is the takeaway?
Don't mess with Maui when he's on the breakaway And the tapestry here on my skin
Is a map of the victories I win
Look where I've been
I make everything happen
Look at that mean mini Maui just tickety-tappin'
Heh, heh, heh ,heh, heh, heh, hey! Well anyway, let me say you're welcome (You're welcome)
For the wonderful world you know
Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome (You're welcome)
Well, come to think of it, I gotta go!
Hey, it's your day to say you're welcome (You're welcome)
'Cause I'm gonna need that boat
I'm sailing away, away, you're welcome (You're welcome)
'Cause Maui can do anything but float! (You're welcome)
You're welcome! (You're welcome)

Disney
2000 Leagues Under the Sea
Got a whale of a tale to tell ya, lads
A whale of a tale or two
'Bout the flapping fish and girls I've loved
On nights like this with the moon above
A whale of a tale and it's all true,
I swear by my tatoo
There was Mermaid Minnie
Met her down in Madagascar
She would kiss me
Anytime that I would ask her
Then one evening
Her flame of love blew out
Blow me down and pick me up,
She swapped me for a trout!
Got a whale of a tale to tell ya, lads
A whale of a tale or two
'Bout the flapping fish and girls I've loved
On nights like this with the moon above
A whale of a tale and it's all true,
I swear by my tatoo
There was Typhoon Tessie
Met her on the coast of Java
When we kissed I
Bubbled up like molten lava
Then she gave me
The scare of my young life
Blow me down, and pick me up
She was the captain's wife!
Got a whale of a tale to tell ya, lads
A whale of a tale or two
'Bout the flapping fish and girls I've loved
On nights like this with the moon above
A whale of a tale and it's all true,
I swear by my tatoo
Then there was Harpoon Hannah
Had a face that made you shudder
Lips like Fish hooks
And a nose just like a rudder
If I kissed her
And held her tenderly
(Held her tenderly)
There's no sea monster big enough
To ever frighten me!
Got a whale of a tale to tell ya, lads
A whale of a tale or two
'Bout the flapping fish and girls I've loved
On nights like this with the moon above
A whale of a tale and it's all true,
I swear by my tatoo! With tuppence for paper and strings
You can have your own set of wings
With your feet on the ground
You're a bird in a flight
With your fist holding tight
To the string of your kite Oh, oh, oh!
Let's go fly a kite
Up to the highest height!
Let's go fly a kite and send it soaring
Up through the atmosphere
Up where the air is clear
Oh, let's go fly a kite! When you send it flyin' up there
All at once you're lighter than air
You can dance on the breeze
Over 'ouses and trees
With your first 'olding tight
To the string of your kite Oh, oh, oh!
Let's go fly a kite
Up to the highest height!
Let's go fly a kite and send it soaring
Up through the atmosphere
Up where the air is clear
Oh, let's go fly a kite! Want to know a secret?
Promise not to tell?
When you're standing by a wishing well
Make a wish into the well
That's all you have to do
And if you hear it echoing
Your wish will soon come true I'm wishing for the one I love
To find me today
I'm hoping
And I'm dreaming of
The nice things he'll say I'm wishing for the one I love
To find me today Today!
Now that I've found you
Hear what I have to say
One Song
I have but one song
One song
Only for you One heart
Tenderly beating
Ever entreating
Constant and true One love
That has possessed me
One love
Thrilling me through One song
My heart keeps singing
Of one love
Only for you Let's get down to business, to defeat the Huns
Did they send me daughters, when I asked for sons?
You're the saddest bunch I ever met
But you can bet before we're through
Mister, I'll make a man out of you Tranquil as a forest but on fire within
Once you find your center, you are sure to win
You're a spineless, pale, pathetic lot
And you haven't got a clue
Somehow I'll make a man out of you I'm never gonna catch my breath
Say goodbye to those who knew me
Boy, was I a fool in school for cutting gym
This guy's got 'em scared to death
Hope he doesn't see right through me
Now I really wish that I knew how to swim Be a man
We must be swift as the coursing river
Be a man
With all the force of a great typhoon
Be a man
With all the strength of a raging fire
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon Time is racing toward us till the Huns arrive
Heed my every order and you might survive
You're unsuited for the rage of war
So pack up, go home, you're through
How could I make a man out of you? Be a man
We must be swift as the coursing river
Be a man
With all the force of a great typhoon
Be a man
With all the strength of a raging fire
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon Be a man
We must be swift as the coursing river
Be a man
With all the force of a great typhoon
Be a man
With all the strength of a raging fire
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon (Ou mata e matagi)
I have crossed the horizon to find you
(Ou loto mamaina toa)
I know your name
(Manatu atu)
They have stolen the heart from inside you
(Taku pelepele)
But this does not define you
(Manatu atu)
This is not who you are
You know who you are Look at this stuff, isn't it neat?
Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?
Wouldn't you think I'm the girl
The girl who has everything?
Look at this trove, treasures untold
How many wonders can one cavern hold?
Lookin' around here you'd think
Sure, she's got everything I've got gadgets and gizmos aplenty
I've got whooz-its and whatz-its galore
You want thingamabobs?
I got twenty
But who cares?
No big deal
I want more I want to be where the people are
I want to see
Want to see 'em dancing
Walking around on those
Whadd'ya call 'em? Oh, feet
Flipping your fins you don't get too far
Legs are required for jumping, dancing
Strolling along down a
What's that word again? Street Up where they walk
Up where they run
Up where they stay all day in the sun
Wandering free
Wish I could be
Part of that world What would I give
If I could live
Out of these waters?
What would I pay
To spend a day
Warm on the sand?
Betcha on land
They understand
That they don't reprimand their daughters
Bright young women
Sick of swimming
Ready to stand And I'm ready to know what the people know
Ask 'em my questions
And get some answers
What's a fire and why does it
What's the word? Burn? When's it my turn?
Wouldn't I love
Love to explore that shore above?
Out of the sea
Wish I could be
Part of that world
Out of the sea
Wish I could be
Part of your world When somebody loved me
Everything was beautiful
Every hour we spent together
Lives within my heart And when she was sad
I was there to dry her tears
And when she was happy so was I
When she loved me Through the summer and the fall
We had each other that was all
Just she and I together
Like it was meant to be And when she was lonely
I was there to comfort her
And I knew that she loved me So the years went by
I stayed the same
She began to drift away
I was left alone Still I waited for the day
When she'd say
I will always love you Lonely and forgotten
Never thought she'd look my way
She smiled at me and held me Just like she used to do
Like she loved me
When she loved me When somebody loved me
Everything was beautiful
Every hour we spent together
Lives within my heart When she loved me, hey All those days watching from the windows
All those years outside looking in
All that time never even knowing
Just how blind I've been
Now I'm here blinking in the starlight
Now I'm here suddenly I see
Standing here it's all so clear
I'm where I'm meant to be And at last I see the light
And it's like the fog has lifted
And at last I see the light
And it's like the sky is new
And it's warm and real and bright
And the world has somehow shifted
All at once everything looks different
Now that I see you All those days chasing down a daydream
All those years living in a blur
All that time never truly seeing
Things, the way they were
Now she's here shining in the starlight
Now she's here suddenly I know
If she's here it's crystal clear
I'm where I'm meant to go And at last I see the light And it's like the fog has lifted And at last I see the light And it's like the sky is new And it's warm and real and bright
And the world has somehow shifted
All at once everything is different
Now that I see you Now that I see you Wonderful, marvelous,
The man with the strength of many.
Brave and bold with a heart of gold,
John Henry was a mighty man.
Born with a hammer right in his hand. Well, come on John,
You're the one that we're depending on.
Swing that hammer with all your might,
I know you can show them how to do it right. John Henry, John Henry,
John Henry is a mighty man.
Born with a hammer,
A ten pound hammer,
A twenty pound hammer right in his hand. I heard John's mama liked to sew at night,
So he pulled down the moon for a little bit of light.
It took a lot of cooking to keep John fed,
Ten dozen eggs and eight loves of bread. John Henry, John Henry,
John Henry is a mighty man.
Born with a hammer, born with a hammer,
Born with a hammer right in his hand. He plowed the earth so wide and deep,
The seed he sowed the ground had to keep.
His hammer hit the earth with such a mighty blow,
Everything he planted would jump up and grow. John Henry, John Henry,
John Henry is a powerful man.
All our lives we've been so poor,
John let me show you what we're working for. Canaan Land, Canaan Land,
Everybody workin' for the Canaan Land.
Home and freedom hand in hand,
Workin' for the Canaan Land. Oh, movin' on down the line,
John Henry came right on time.
Movin' on down the line,
John Henry came right on time. Home and freedom hand in hand,
Workin' for the Canaan Land. John Henry, John Henry,
John Henry is a mighty man.
John Henry, John Henry,
John Henry is a powerful man. Steel drivin' man,
John Henry was.
Steel drivin' man,
Oh yes he was.
So proud, defiant,
A gentle giant,
A steel drivin' natural man. Well, a-come on, John,
You're the one that we're dependin' on.
Swing that hammer, bust that rock,
Come on, give it everything you've got. John Henry, John Henry,
John Henry is a mighty man.
Born with a hammer, born with a hammer,
Born with a hammer right in his hand. John and the drill made the valley shake,
Rumblin' almost caused an earthquake.
Thunder and lightning was everywhere,
Oh, Lord, that battle was beyond compare. John Henry, John Henry,
John Henry is a powerful man.
Born with a hammer, born with a hammer,
Born with a hammer right in his hand. No mountain too high,
No valley too low,
No river too wide,
No place too far to go. If you believe, you can overcome.
The battle is already won,
Just keep on keepin' on.
Stand tall, just like John. No matter who you are,
No matter where you're from,
Nothing can stop you,
From who you can become. Just keep on keepin' on,
Stand tall, just like John.
Just keep on keepin' on,
Stand tall, just like John. No matter who you are,
No matter where you're from,
Nothing can stop you,
From who you can become. Just keep on keepin' on,
Stand tall, just like John.
Just keep on keepin' on,
Stand tall, just like John.
Just keep on keepin' on,
Stand tall, just like John.
Just keep on keepin' on,
Stand tall, just like John. Do you wanna build a snowman?
Come on let's go and play
I never see you anymore
Come out the door
It's like you've gone away We used to be best buddies
And now we're not
I wish you would tell me why!
Do you wanna build a snowman?
It doesn't have to be a snowman
Okay, bye Do you wanna build a snowman?
Or ride our bikes around the halls
I think some company is overdue
I've started talking to the
Pictures on the walls It gets a little lonely
All these empty rooms (these empty rooms)
Just watching the hours
Tick by Do you wanna build a snowman?
(Do you wanna build a snowman?)
It doesn't have to be a snowman
(Don't have to be a snowman)
Okay, bye Elsa?
Please, I know you're in there (I know you're in there)
People are asking where you've been
They say, "have courage" and I'm trying to (trying to)
I'm right out here for you (here for you)
Just let me in (just let me in) We only have each other (we only have each other)
It's just you and me
What are we gonna do? (what are we gonna do?) Do you wanna build a snowman?
Do you wanna build a snowman?
It doesn't have to be a snowman
Okay, bye Some day my prince will come
Some day we'll meet again
And away to his castle we'll go
To be happy forever I know Some day when spring is here
We'll find a love anew
And the birds will sing
And wedding bells will ring
Someday when my dreams come true La la lu, La la lu
Oh, my little star sweeper
I'll sweep the stardust for you La la lu, La la lu
Little soft fluffy sleeper
Here comes a pink cloud for you La la lu, La la lu
Little wandering angel
Fold up your wings close your eyes La la lu, La la lu
And may love be your keeper
La la lu, La la lu, La la lu Hakuna Matata!
What a wonderful phrase
Hakuna Matata!
Ain't no passing craze It means no worries
For the rest of your days
It's our problem-free philosophy
Hakuna Matata! Why, when he was a young warthog
When I was a young wart-hoooog!
Very nice!
Thanks!
He found his aroma lacked a certain appeal
He could clear the Savannah after every meal
I'm a sensitive soul, though I seem thick-skinned
And it hurt that my friends never stood downwind
And oh, the shame
(He was ashamed!)
Thought of changin' my name
(Oh, what's in a name?)
And I got downhearted
(How did you feel?)
Every time that I-
Pumbaa! Not in front of the kids!
Oh... sorry Hakuna Matata!
What a wonderful phrase
Hakuna Matata!
Ain't no passing craze
It means no worries
For the rest of your days
Yeah, sing it, kid!
It's our problem-free philosophy
Hakuna Matata! Hakuna Matata
Hakuna Matata
Hakuna Matata
Hakuna It means no worries
For the rest of your days
It's our problem-free philosophy
Hakuna Matata From the day we arrive on the planet
And blinking, step into the sun
There's more to see than can ever be seen
More to do than can ever be done There's far too much to take in here
More to find than can ever be found
But the sun rolling high
Through the sapphire sky
Keeps great and small on the endless round It's the circle of life
And it moves us all
Through despair and hope
Through faith and love Till we find our place
On the path unwinding
In the circle
The circle of life It's the circle of life
And it moves us all
Through despair and hope
Through faith and love Till we find our place
On the path unwinding
In the circle
The circle of life Mmmmmm
Mmmmmm
So this is love
Mmmmmm
So this is love
So this is what makes life divine
I'm all aglow, mmmmmm
And now I know
And now I know
The key to all heaven is mine
My heart has wings, mmmmmm
And I can fly
I'll touch every star in the sky
So this is the miracle
That I've been dreaming of
Mmmmmm
Mmmmmm
So this is love Oh, this is the night, it's a beautiful night
And we call it bella notte
Look at the skies, they have stars in their eyes
On this lovely bella notte Side by side with your loved one
You'll find enchantment here
The night will weave its magic spell
When the one you love is near For this is the night, and the heavens are right
On this lovely bella notte This is the night, it's a beautiful night
And we call it bella notte
Look at the skies, they have stars in their eyes
On this lovely bella notte Side by side with your loved one
You'll find enchantment here
The night will weave its magic spell
When the one you love is near For this is the night, and the heavens are right
On this lovely bella notte Look at me,
I will never pass for a perfect bride, or a perfect daughter.
Can it be,
I'm not meant to play this part?
Now I see, that if I were truly to be myself,
I would break my family's heart. Who is that girl I see, staring straight back at me?
Why is my reflection someone I don't know?
Somehow I cannot hide
Who I am, though I've tried.
When will my reflection show, who I am, inside?
How I pray, that a time will come,
I can free myself, from their expectations
On that day, I'll discover someway to be myself, and to make my family proud.
They want a docile lamb,
No-one knows who I am.
Must there be a secret me,
I'm forced to hide?
Must I pretend that I am someone else for all time?
When will my reflection show, who I am inside?
When will my reflection show, who I am inside? I know you
I walked with you
Once Upon a dream
I know you That gleam in your eyes
Is so familiar a gleam
Yet I know it's true
That visions are seldom what they seem But if I know you
I know what you do
You'll love me at once
The way you did once upon a dream La da la da la ahahahahah
But if I know you
I know what you do
You'll love me at once The way you did once upon a dream
I know you
I walked with you
Once Upon a dream I know you
That gleam in your eyes
Is so familiar a gleam
Yet I know it's true That visions are seldom what they seem
But if I know you
I know what you do
You'll love me at once The way you did once upon a dream There's a calm surrender to the rush of day
When the heat of the rolling world can be turned away
An enchanted moment and it sees me through
It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you And can you feel the love tonight? It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer that we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight? How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds believe the very best There's a time for everyone, if they only learn
That the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours And can you feel the love tonight? It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer that we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight? How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds believe the very best
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds believe the very best Ou mata e matagi

and keep on swaying Chief Tui:
Moana, make way, make way!
Moana, it's time you knew
The village of Motunui is
All you need The dancers are practising
They dance to an ancient song
(Who needs a new song? This old one's all we need) This tradition is our mission
And Moana, there's so much to do
(Make way!)
Don't trip on the taro root
That's all you need We share everything we make
(We make)
We joke and we weave our baskets
(Aha!)
The fishermen come back from the sea Moana:
I wanna see Chief Tui:
Don't walk away
Moana, stay on the ground now
Our people will need a chief
And there you are Chief Tui and Sina:
There comes a day
When you're gonna look around
And realize happiness is
Where you are Chief Tui:
Consider the coconut
(The what?)
Consider its tree
We use each part of the coconut
That's all we need Sina:
We make our nets from the fibers
(We make our nets from the fibers)
The water is sweet inside
(The water is sweet inside)
We use the leaves to build fires
(We use the leaves to build fires)
We cook up the meat inside
(We cook up the meat inside) Chief Tui:
Consider the coconuts
(Consider the coconuts)
The trunks and the leaves
(Ha!)
The island gives us what we need Moana:
And no one leaves Chief Tui:
That's right, we stay
We're safe and we're well provided
And when we look to the future
There you are You'll be okay
In time you'll learn just as I did
Chief Tui and Sina:
You must find happiness right
Where you are Gramma Tala:
I like to dance with the water
The undertow and the waves
The water is mischievous
Ha! I like how it misbehaves The village may think I'm crazy
Or say that I drift too far
But once you know what you like, well
There you are You are your father's daughter
Stubbornness and pride
Mind what he says but remember
You may hear a voice inside
And if the voice starts to whisper
To follow the farthest star
Moana, that voice inside is
Who you are Villagers:
We make our nets from the fibers
(We weave our nets from the fibers)
The water is sweet inside
(And we taste the sweet inside)
We use the leaves to build fires
(We sing these songs in our choir)
We cook up the meat inside
(We have mouths to feed inside) Chief Tui:
The village believes in us
(That's right!)
The village believes
(Ha!)
The island gives us what we need
And no one leaves Moana:
So here I'll stay
My home, my people beside me
And when I think of tomorrow
There we are I'll lead the way
I'll have my people to guide me
We'll build our future together
Villagers: Where we are Moana:
'Cause every path leads you back to
Villagers:
Where you are
Moana:
You can find happiness right -
Villagers:
Where you are
Where you are Don't you disrespect me little man
Don't you derogate or deride
You're in my world now, not your world
And I got friends on the other side
(He's got friends on the other side) That's and echo gentleman
Just a little something we have here in Louisiana
A little parlor trick, don't worry Sit down at my table, put your mind at ease
If you relax it will enable me to do anything I please
I can read your future, I can change it 'round some too
I look deep into your heart and soul You do have have a soul, don't you, Lawrence?
Make your wildest dreams come true I got voodoo, I got voodoo
I got things I didn't even try
And I got friends on the other side
(He's got friends on the other side) The cards, the cards, the cards will tell
The past, the present and the future as well
The cards, the cards, just take three
Take a little trip into your future with me Now you, young man are from across the sea
You come from two long lines of royalty
I'm a royal myself on my mother's side
Your lifestyle's high but your funds are low
You need to marry a little honey who's daddy got dough Mom and dad cut you off, huh, playboy?
Now y'all better get hitched but hitching ties you down
You just want to be free, hop from place to place
But freedom takes green It's the green, it's the green, it's the green you need
And when I look into your future it's the green that I see On you little man, I don't want wanna waste much time
You've been pushed 'round all your life
You've been pushed 'round by your mother
And your sister and your brother
And if you was married you'd be pushed 'round by your wife But in your future the you I see
Is exactly the man you always wanted to be
Shake my hand, come on boys
Won't you shake a poor sinner's hand? Yes, are you ready?
(Are you ready?)
Are you ready? Transformation central
Transformation central
Transformation central
Transformation central Transformafication central, can you feel it?
You're changing, you're changing, you're changing alright
I hope you're satisfied, but if you ain't don't blame me
You can blame my friends on the other side You got what you wanted
What you want's what you get
Hush Ain't it a glorious day?
Right as a mornin' in May
I feel like I could fly
Have you ever seen the grass
So green, or a bluer sky? Oh it's a jolly 'oliday with Mary
Mary makes your 'eart so light!
When the day is gray and ordianry
Mary makes the sun shine bright!
Oh, 'appiness is bloomin' all around 'er
The daffodils are smilin' at the dove
When Mary 'olds your 'and
You feel so grand
Your 'eart starts beatin' like
A big brass band!
It's a jolly 'oliday with Mary
No wonder that it's Mary that we love! Oh it's a jolly 'oliday with Mary
Mary makes your 'eart so light!
When the day is gray and ordianry
Mary makes the sun shine bright!
Oh, 'appiness is bloomin' all around 'er
The daffodils are smilin' at the dove
When Mary 'olds your 'and
You feel so grand
Your 'eart starts beatin' like
A big brass band!
It's a jolly 'oliday with Mary
No wonder that it's Mary that we love! Oh, it's a jolly holiday with you, Bert
Gentlemen like you are few
Though you're just a diamond
In the rough, Bert
Underneath your blood is blue!
You'd never think of pressing
Your advantage
Forbearance is the hallmark of your creed
A lady needn't fear when you are near
Your sweet gentility is crystal clear!
Oh, it's a jolly holiday with you, Bert
A jolly, jolly holiday with you! It's true that Mavis and Sybil 'ave
Ways that are winning
And Prudence and Gwendolyn
Set your 'eart spinning
Phoebe's delightful, Maude is disarming
Janice, Felicia, Lydia--charming
Cynthia's dashing, Vivian's sweet
Stephanie's smashing, Priscilla a treat
Veronica, Millicent, Agnes, and Jane
Convivial company, time and again
Dorcas and Phyllis and Glynis are sorts
I'll agree are three jolly good sports
But cream of the crop, tip of the top
It's Mary Poppins, and there we stop! If I never knew you
If I never felt this love
I would have no inkling of
How precious life can be And if I never knew you
I would never have a clue
How at last I'd find in you
The missing part of me In this world so full of fear
Full of rage and lies
I can see the truth so clear
In your eyes
So dry your eyes And I'm so grateful to you
I'd have lived my whole life through
Lost forever
If I never knew you If I never knew you
I'd be safe but half as real
Never knowing I could feel
A love so strong and true I'm so grateful to you
I'd have lived my whole life through
Lost forever
If I never knew you I thought our love would be so beautiful Somehow we made the whole world bright I never knew that fear and hate could be so strong
All they'd leave us were these whispers in the night
But still my heart is singing
We were right If I never knew you
There's no moment I regret
If I never knew this love
I would have no inkling of
If our time has gone too fast I've lived at last
How precious life can be I thought our love would be so beautiful
Somehow we'd make the whole world bright I thought our love would be so beautiful
We'd turn the darkness into light And still my heart is singing
We were right We were right
And if I never knew you
I'd have lived my whole life through Empty as the sky Never knowing why
Lost forever I know you
I walked with you
Once Upon a dream
I know you That gleam in your eyes
Is so familiar a gleam
Yet I know it's true
That visions are seldom what they seem But if I know you
I know what you do
You'll love me at once
The way you did once upon a dream La da la da la ahahahahah
But if I know you
I know what you do
You'll love me at once The way you did once upon a dream
I know you
I walked with you
Once Upon a dream I know you
That gleam in your eyes
Is so familiar a gleam
Yet I know it's true That visions are seldom what they seem
But if I know you
I know what you do
You'll love me at once The way you did once upon a dream You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
When the road looks rough ahead
And you're miles and miles
From your nice warm bed
Just remember what your old pal said
Boy, you've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
You've got troubles, well I've got 'em too
There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you
We stick together and we see it through
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me Some other folks might be
A little bit smarter than I am
Bigger and stronger too
Maybe
But none of them will ever love you the way I do
It's me and you
And as the years go by
Boys, our friendship will never die
You're gonna see
It's our destiny
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me I have often dreamed of a far off place
Where a hero's welcome would be waiting for me
Where the crowds would cheer, when they see my face
And a voice keeps saying this is where I'm meant to be I'll be there someday, I can go the distance
I will find my way if I can be strong
I know every mile would be worth my while
When I go the distance, I'll be right where I belong Down an unknown road to embrace my fate
Though that road may wander, it will lead me to you
And a thousand years would be worth the wait
It might take a lifetime but somehow I'll see it through And I won't look back, I can go the distance
And I'll stay on track, no I won't accept defeat
It's an uphill slope
But I won't loose hope, 'till I go the distance
And my journey is complete, oh yeah But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part
For a hero's strength is measured by his heart, oh Like a shooting star, I will go the distance
I will search the world, I will face its harms
I don't care how far, I can go the distance
'Till I find my hero's welcome waiting in your arms I will search the world, I will face its harms
'Till I find my hero's welcome waiting in your arms I've got no strings
To hold me down
To make me fret
Or make me frown
I had strings
But now I'm free
There are no strings on me Hi-ho the me-ri-o
That's the only way to go
I want the world to know
Nothing ever worries me I've got no strings
So I have fun
I'm not tied up to anyone
They've got strings
But you can see
There are no strings on me You have no strings
Your arms is free
To love me by the Zuider Zee
Ya, ya, ya
If you would woo
I'd bust my strings for you You've got no strings
Comme ci comme ca
Your savoire-faire is ooh la la
I've got strings
But entre nous
I'd cut my strings for you Down where the Volga flows
There's a Russian rendezvous
Where me and Ivan go
But I'd rather go with you, hey There are no strings on me Come stop your crying
It will be alright
Just take my hand
And hold it tight I will protect you
From all around you
I will be here
Don't you cry For one so small,
You seem so strong
My arms will hold you,
Keep you safe and warm
This bond between us
Can't be broken
I will be here
Don't you cry 'Cause you'll be in my heart
Yes, you'll be in my heart
From this day on
Now and forever more
You'll be in my heart
No matter what they say
You'll be here in my heart
Always Why can't they understand the way we feel
They just don't trust what they can't explain
I know we're different, but deep inside us
We're not that different at all And you'll be in my heart
Yes you'll be in my heart
From this day on
Now and forever more Don't listen to them
'Cause what do they know
We need each other, to have, to hold
They'll see in time, I know When destiny calls you, you must be strong
I may not be with you
But you got to hold on
They'll see in time, I know
We'll show them together 'Cause you'll be in my heart
Believe me you'll be in my heart
I'll be there from this day on
Now and forever more You'll be in my heart
No matter what they say
You'll be here in my heart
Always Always I'll be with you
I'll be there for you always
Always and always Just look over your shoulder
Just look over your shoulder
Just look over your shoulder

I done sacrificed it all, paid the dues and costs
Life will test us all, let's see if we true or false
I walk up to my fate and stared that shit in the face
Hungry for the competition, bitch get on my plate

And I realized all I needed was in me, nigga
S on my chest boy, so shots can't even pinch me, nigga

We The Best Music
DJ Khaled Please, Khaled, don't pair me or compare me
Unless the said party is a rare breed
The stories I hear, they tend to mirror me
At this point now, rap is only therapy
President Push, I'm more Eric B
I ain't no joke, check out my melody
Felony, felony, felony, that's all they selling me
But 2 million in large bills is billing me
I was on the wrong side of the law
Like Pac was on the wrong side of the car
Like B.I.G. at the Soul Train Awards
The moral is all grace been driven
G Wagons are bulletproof
The ones before me got snatched like bullet tooth
Tony nigga, only one left from the drug era
The jewelry weighs more in the drug mirror Yeah, what you see when you look in the mirror, nigga? Haha
Yeah, I know who the fuck I am Yuugh, tell me how you fit in
Was you a street nigga when Nas said it's written
When Reasonable Doubt dropped, how was you living?
I was leading up the grinding in my kitchen
Getting work from Detroit like a piston
We was on a mission, stuff it in a Michelin
I could spend a year reminiscing
The length of your career, reminiscing
We can't occupy the same space
We ain't even running the same race
When it come to these bitches, it ain't the same chase
Moynat versus lean, we ain't the same taste
Therefore, it's no comparison
To be mentioned with you niggas is embarrassing
I am one Joe blow, you know my narrative
Clear your sinus like Claritin
Push When you look in the mirror, what do you see, nigga?
'Cause I know when I look in the mirror, I know what I see
You peasants don't deserve my presence You portraying other individuals
Me, I'm just weighing my residuals
From where success is the bare minimal
You a rapper, I'm a criminal
I had money before they found y'all
That's why I feel funny around y'all
Lord, bless those praying for my downfall
If I get too deep, don't let me drown, y'all
Hearing 'em talking 'bout how to flip a key
Started moving that Daddy Kane and Nicky D
Had the whole YPD sick of me
Don't sit, if you get tired, just pick a knee
Bet it all or bet it large
Now the coke or these pills, the crack, all these credit cards
I just laughed and I shrug at it
'Cause the niggas with the money are the drug addicts

Up down, up down, up down
'Cause all I do is win win win
And if you goin' in put your hands in the air
Make 'em stay there (Luda!)
Ludacris goin' in on the verse
Cause I never been defeated and I won't stop now
Keep your hands up get 'em in the sky for the homies
That didn't make it and the folks locked down
I never went no where
But they saying Luda's back
Blame it on that Conjure
The hood call it Luda-Yac
And I'm on this foolish track, so I spit my foolish flow
My hands go up and down like strippers booty's go
My verses still be serving, tight like a million virgins
Last time on a Khaled remix, now I'm on the original version
Can't never count me out
Y'all better count me in
Got twenty bank accounts, accountants count me in
Make millions every year, the south's champion
Cause all I do, all I, all I, all I

Clean as a whistle as I pull out in my Rolls Royce
Yellow bone passenger they see it, they say oh boy!
Tell Khaled back it up, my niggas call me Loco
Down for armed trafficking, don't make me pull that fo-fo
Ask you what you laughing at
Represent that mud life (mud life)
Dirty money bitch you better get your mug right (mug right)

Now she riding with me cause you wasn't ridin' her right, All I do is win win win no matter what

Water getting boiled, dope being sold
Snoopy in the hoopty, system overload
I've been runnin' this rap game since I was twenty years old
I hung with the worst of 'em
Bust till I burst on 'em
Floss 'em up, toss 'em up, Hardaway, cross 'em up
Pardon me I'm bossin' up, pressure up, bless ya bruh
Don't mess with us
We like the "U" in the 80's
Back to back set a trap
Hit the lick, get it back
Hit the trick, jump the track
Bitch I want my money back
Time and time again while I'm sipping on this gin
Al Davis said it best, just win baby win All I do is win win win no matter what
Got money on my mind I can never get enough

I ain't work this hard since I was eighteen
Apologize if I say, anything I don't mean
Like whats up with your best friend?
We could all have some fun, believe me
And whats up with these new niggas?
And why they think it all comes so easy But get it while you here boy
Cause all that hype don't feel the same next year boy
Yeah and I'll be right here in my spot
With a little more cash than I already got
Trippin' off you 'cause you had your shot
With my skin tanned and my hair long
And my fans who been so patient,
Me and forty back to work but we still smell like a vacation
Hate the rumors, hate your bullshit
Hate these fucking allegations,
I'm just feeling like the throne is for the taking, watch me take it All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it till it's done
And I don't really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older so somebody shoulda told ya I'm on one, yeah,
Fuck it, I'm on one
Yeah, I said I'm on one fuck it, I'm on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be gotten and I'ma get that shit
Cause I'm on one, I said fuck it I'm on one I'm burning purple flowers
It's burning my chest
I bury the most cash and burning the rest
Walking on the clouds, suspended in thin air
Do ones beneath me recognize the red bottoms I wear
Burner in the belt
Move the kids to the hills (Boss)
Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill
Kiss you on ya neck and tell ya everything is great
Even though I'm out on bond I might be facin' eight's
Still running with the same niggas 'til the death of me
Ever seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully
Ever made love to the woman of your dreams
In a room full of money out in London as she screams
Baby, I could take it there
Call Marc Jacobs personally to make a pair
So yeah, we on one, the feeling ain't fair (Khaled)
And it's double M G until I get the chair All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it till it's done
And I don't really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older so somebody shoulda told ya I'm on one, yeah,
Fuck it, I'm on one
Yeah, I said I'm on one, fuck it, I'm on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be gotten and I'ma get that shit
Cause I'm on one, I said fuck it I'm on one I walk around the club,

And all my niggas got that Heat I feel like Pat Riley
Yeah, too much money, ain't enough money
You know the feds listening,

You niggas on the bench
Like the bus coming
Huh, ain't nothing sweet but the swishas
I'm focused might aswell say cheese for the pictures
Oh, I'm about to go Andre the Giant
You a sell out, but I ain't buying
Chopper dissect a nigga like science
Put an end to the world like Mayans
It's a celebration bitches, Mazel Tov
It's a slim chance I fall, olive oil
Tunechi be the name, don't ask me how I got it
I'm killin' these hoes I swear I'm tryna stop the violence All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it till it's done
And I don't really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older so somebody shoulda told ya I'm on one yeah,
Fuck it, I'm on one

Where they at?
Put em up! I'm hotter than a Kawasaki in the projects
Burning more than rubber, money ain't a object
I'm number 1, and hurt they feelings in the process
Cop a bird, then your really seein progress
I'm buying cars like I'm in a contest
Say my name, rappers lookin like a bomb threat
I'm the winner, these beginners talking nonsense
Brain from your ? till she render me unconscious
I'm so conscious of DNA in my closet
My show account can't take another deposit
Ladies heartthrob labelled me the odd ball
3.5 cause I'm known to start small [Chorus]
If you from the streets like me, put your hands up!
D Boys on my tease, put your hands up!
Independent bad bitches, put your hands up!
If you know this how you living, put your hands up!
Where they at?
Put em up! If you know this how you living, put your hands up!
Put em up!
Where they at?
Put em up This the biggest street anthem in the hood right now
I got the streets on fire with this one
Somebody pass my ?
That's the new thug passion
This we the best music
Put your hands up! I'll hold you down
I'm on my way All you've been thinking about
Do anything you want and let emotion rule your mind (Rule your mind)
And now you say you dream about doing it anyway

And now she wanna roll
I hate to see her leave sometimes
But that ass on "woah" My lil' baby on thick, thick
Girl that ass too fat, so don't quit
You know I like it like that, don't quit
You're doin' good right now, don't quit
Put your old jeans on, now they won't fit
My lil' baby on thick, thick
Girl that ass too fat, so don't quit
You know I like it like that, so don't quit (Let's go!) Yah, yah
Another one I'm on my way
This goin' out to every hood
We gonna make it [Chorus]
You can look into my eyes
See that I'm dead tired
6 in the morning
Money still on my mind
So if you want it
I'm the one to supply
Be there in no time, no time, no time
I'm on my way-ay-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay
I'm on my way-ay-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay

No ordinary shit
No ordinary bitches
No ordinary whips
4 bills nigga special like the 38
I came along way from food stamps in section 8
Niggas eatin' on these beats
Get yourself a plate
And I'm a step away
One hit, one breath away
When on God time, you ain't never late
Come so victory is here
We can celebrate OK, I'm on my grizzle
On my grind
Go ahead try, top my shine

Tell them niggas better have my cake

Ain't got nothin' to do with you [Chorus] Victory is on the way
Khaled go in on 'em
Show 'em we gonna win homey
Get off in their skin homey

So you think a nigga pussy cause his ear's pierced
Run up on a nigga if you want to
You gotta vest i gotta a shell that'll go through
Ball Greezy gettin' money like ya 'posed to
Good dope in the drop like soul food
Big Body, big rims on the old school
Stay fly like a hood nigga 'posed too
Lights off click clack in the pinto
Seat back, dick sucked in the Benzo
5 percent D-B's on the Renzo
No sleep, gotta eat, gotta get done It's like I always say
Motherfucka' here I come
Another victory for the crib
A couple more before I'm done
And if you asleep you better wake up
And get on your fuckin' job
Cause I'm takin' everything except a loss
Iceburg goes off, yeah 24-7 I goes on
And I be scared I might miss money
So I don't doze off
I'm a snap and the streets know it
Trick told me keep goin'
An I'm a keep Chiefin' as long as God keep the weed growin' [Chorus] Switch man been to a ?
I've been destined to shine
Won't take no for an answer
Fuck nigga gimme mine
Never been selfish for real

A wise speaker, a woman pleaser
Broke nigga, reverend
Mr O-10, I get it in

Better not be phoney
Get on my level
Cause they way below me

Girls ask me what my cologne is
Steel Khakis and Coronas
And I'm mackin' a donkey
Flip the 4 and a half

Bet da Ave never seen banks chunky as dat
Why you got pressure?

Pussy so wet I'mma need Dramamine and mattress Aquafining
Boy I light the block up, young Billie Jeaning
I'm dodging the leeches, I'm signing agreements
I'm signing new artists, I sell out arenas
Swimming with the dolphins on the Dan Marino
Wine mixing, this shit like the Catalina
B-I-G, minus Puff and Lil Cease
I'm on my grind, 3 AM text like I need ya
Dream about the pussy, fuck it I'm a dreamer
Hold me down but don't hold me back like I need you to, damn
I wrote myself a million dollar check in fifth grade
I put it on the wall and promised it'd be this way
She fuck me like she want the rent paid
Like she want that Oscar De La Renta
I slow it down like it's her favorite ballad
Then go back up at it like I hadn't had it
Straight up How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
I'll fuck you right, have you walking from side to side
How many times? Pour a cup for the bitches that ain't scared to get down
Get down, get down
How many times I gotta?
Light another for the bitches who's just only in town
For the weekend, ohh I see these bitches in Supperclub
Niggas got me throwing bottles up
Bottles with all of my homies
I'm feeling generous, throwing my money
She said she wanted the molly love
I gave her the dick but I'm not in love
I call out, "Bingo!" the minute I'm boning
Soon as I'm done, kick her out in the morning
Got xans when I turn up, it's a party, bust it open
Pop that pussy in a circle, go retarded, pop it for me
She got that booty galore, gripping it, backing me up
You wanna fuck with a thug
Now I see all these bitches got ass and they throwing
Damn, it's just a matter of time 'fore I'm gone
Drinking Ciroc and I know that she got it for free
I hit up Diddy, he told me he did it
He said that the liquor just bring out the freaks
Them bitches lit, dropping that ass to a split
Talking 'bout me, I'm the shit
I just get down for the money, the bitches, and cars
And my niggas, they whipping the bricks How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
I'll fuck you right, have you walking from side to side

Hey, yeah (we the best) All I do is win win win no matter what
Got money on my mind I can never get enough
And every time I step up in the buildin'
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there
And they say yeah
And they stay there
Up down, up down, up down
'Cause all I do is win win win
And if you goin' in put your hands in the air
Make 'em stay there (Luda!)
Ludacris goin' in on the verse
Cause I never been defeated and I won't stop now
Keep your hands up get 'em in the sky for the homies
That didn't make it and the folks locked down
I never went no where
But they saying Luda's back
Blame it on that Conjure
The hood call it Luda-Yac
And I'm on this foolish track, so I spit my foolish flow
My hands go up and down like strippers booty's go
My verses still be serving, tight like a million virgins
Last time on a Khaled remix, now I'm on the original version
Can't never count me out
Y'all better count me in
Got twenty bank accounts, accountants count me in
Make millions every year, the south's champion
Cause all I do, all I, all I, all I
All I do is All I do is win win win no matter what
Got money on my mind I can never get enough
And every time I step up in the buildin'
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there

Up down, up down, up down
'Cause all I do is win win win
And if you goin' in put your hands in the air
Make 'em stay there Swerving in my lo-lo,
Head on the swivel
You know serving me's a no no
Clean as a whistle as I pull out in my Rolls Royce
Yellow bone passenger they see it, they say oh boy!
Tell Khaled back it up, my n****s call me Loco
Down for armed trafficking, don't make me pull that fo-fo
Ask you what you laughing at
Represent that mud life (mud life)
Dirty money b**** you better get your mug right (mug right)
We come together holding hands and holla thug life (thug life)

It's like f*** life
(All we do is win)
You riding or what (what!)
'Cause we riding tonight (night!)
Now she riding with me cause you wasn't ridin' her right, All I do is win win win no matter what
Got money on my mind I can never get enough
And every time I step up in the buildin'
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there
And they say yeah
And they stay there
Up down, up down, up down
'Cause all I do is win win win
And if you goin' in put your hands in the air
Make 'em stay there Heat in the kitchen, pot on the stove
Water getting boiled, dope being sold
Snoopy in the hoopty, system overload
I've been runnin' this rap game since I was twenty years old
I hung with the worst of 'em
Bust till I burst on 'em
Floss 'em up, toss 'em up, Hardaway, cross 'em up
Pardon me I'm bossin' up, pressure up, bless ya bruh
Don't mess with us
We like the "U" in the 80's
Back to back set a trap
Hit the lick, get it back
Hit the trick, jump the track
B**** I want my money back
Time and time again while I'm sipping on this gin
Al Davis said it best, just win baby win All I do is win win win no matter what
Got money on my mind I can never get enough
And every time I step up in the buildin'
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there
And they say yeah

Two seaters every season, and I just begun
Aquafina, she dripping puddles on a sunny day
Multi-million dollar plays and that's a hundred ways
Fuck a fashion, we come mashing out her man's seats
Top down, JFK, I pray he get impeached
Say no names, Supreme underwear, and like eighty chains
Hundred for the rich forever perspective, never change
Petty bitches posting niggas like they were wedding pictures
Evidently, I'm getting richer, tricking seven figures
Ain't no difference when you see or that's on television
Chasing a hundred million, baby that's my natural ambition
Boss All my life, that's on everything, yeah
This forever, I put that on everything, yeah
If I ever, I move onto better things

Yeah, I just pull up in my everything, yeah yeah
Got a matching Rollie, that's on everything (Straight up)
That's on my life, yeah, yeah I took my life and bossed it up
I took the risk, coin tossed it up
I just left work to work some more, I'm still a workaholic
I done sacrificed it all, paid the dues and costs
Life will test us all, let's see if we true or false
I walk up to my fate and stared that shit in the face
Hungry for the competition, bitch get on my plate
No mercy, no grace, I'm checkin' off my to-do list
There's no room off in the schedule its only room for improvement
And I realized all I needed was in me, nigga
S on my chest boy, so shots can't even pinch me, nigga
No substitute for me, but they gon' still tempt me nigga
God is in me, that's the only one who can end me nigga
And we seen more blessings than a Baptist Ebenezer
My daddy says you got a good girl, she's a keeper
Boy, I'm a Caesar, I see shit and seize it
Roc-A-Fella chain, but you can still get Ethered
Yeah, they don't really fucking feel me man, but when you really run it they try and clip your Achilles
I'm on track to a billi', I got Khaled fuckin' with me
That mean I got the Holy Key and the key to the city, lil' nigga All my life, that's on everything, yeah

Doing what I gotta do
What up though?
We the best music
I guess I'm on my Don shit
What that mean?
I'mma go
DJ Khaled Straight up, late nights mixed with early days
It'll probably be that way until the Pearly Gates
Stress weighing on me, they want me to nervous break
These hoes showing fake love when I prefer the hate, man (Sheesh)
At least if you real then I have to respect it
Realize the energy you give is what you manifested
So understand we positive as could be
The vision is still intact, the show is fresh out of seats
Boy it's never going south 'less we down in South Beach
Khaled on the jet skiis, preaching what you believe in
Everything fast 'cept the food, watch what we eating
If it add a couple years to our life, then we might go vegan
Woah, I hear a little bit of me in all your favorite rappers
You know it's true, bitch I need respect due
Now or later, either way I'mma take it, just like it's fuckin' taxes
No wonder I'm on fire, I done been to Hell and back bitch
Lately I been living life in detachment
I practice seven spiritual laws and cut off distractions
We been all in the Hollywood Hills, and never been acting
Detroit gave me an accent and Christ gave me his passion
Father help us, police doing target practice with real bodies
Mommas in the streets, crying, standing over a still body
Niggas over stressing, we under investigation
Every day off to the races, can't fuck with you if you racist
Beat your ass until you purple, they can't even tell what your race is
Doctor King meet Dr. Dre, except this doctor lost all his patience
Have you tied up in a basement with you and your partner facing adjacent
Until you deposit payment or reparations
If you shoot me then you gotta deal with a holy me
It feel like I'm finally free and unlock my spirit with the holy key
(The holy key, the holy key, the holy key) And I'mma celebrate it for a long time
The drama couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key
And I'mma celebrate it for a long time
The drama couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key Everything I touch may disintegrate into dust (Uh huh)
Everything I trust may dishonor me in disgust (Come on)
Everything is everything, affidavits and wedding rings
Out for blood on my higher horse, I report what it was
I don't wear crosses no more, Yeshua's coming back
I ain't scared of losses no more, I see life in that
I don't resonate with the concept of love and hate
'Cause your perspective is less effective and rather fake
The universe and the heavens work in my DNA
Kendrick said "Fuck Mother Earth," that's PSA
The land of the wicked, the foundation of Lucifer's spirit
Walking zombies and spellcatchers, I pray for forgiveness
Uncle Bobby and Paul June is lost again
The underworld and the fourth dimension, my family's in
The big money, the fast cars, my life produced
The blocks I connected while re-building this Rubix cube
So what you look up to?
Fame and fortune, bitches, Porsches, sources with designer thing
Brand endorsement joining forces with sorcerers signing me
Law enforcement their forces, tortures us with violent speed
Fuck your boss's employment my joy is to see all you bleed
Who knew Royce's with choices of color my desire need
Crab and Oyster with gorgeous abortions, I require thee
Flesh and poison the point is the reason, you won't die in peace
Open door for my boy, now they eating, we say, finally
I destroy and divorce what you eating, don't you hire me
Tape recording my voices and tweak it, let's play hide and seek
War distortion and forfeit this evening, you should try at least
I'm restoring the portrait of feasting, nigga, I am beast
I don't like to sleep, I'm up like coyote, I might OD
Hair like ODB, I'm off a higher need
Khaled is valid, I been looking for inspiration
But when you the only king, you the only one in the matrix And I'mma celebrate it for a long time
The drama couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key
And I'mma celebrate it for a long time
The drama couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key Holy, Holy key, holy Yeah, yeah yeah yeah (ohh, yeah)

A click full of real niggas that's just the one thing about us
They showin' us love, but I remember back then the niggas would doubt us

DJ Khaled! A divine leader
Shine brighter, bonita mami meet a line sniffer
Never, poetic rhyme writer, chiefer
Ebony empress getter
Celebrity Apprentice a devil show
Big up to Africa, Mexico
Hennessy, margarita, venison eater
So dear spread 'em here, don't be actin' innocent either
Dome me, relax me, it's only to the nasty
I'm just a phony assassin
A lot of niggas owe me, I'mma tax 'em
A lot of sisters hold me to somethin' holy and Catholic
'Cause the rosary and gold flashy
Just an attachment and accessory to my dress code
Now everywhere all I see is Pablo, Esco
Last time I checked I was still breathin'
My neck was still freezin', now everybody got an Escobar Season
To every baby on the album cover existin'
This trend I was settin' it came to fruition
I'm assistin' to push the culture forward
To all my go supporters, go support us
Like a local black-owned grocery store
'Cause in the hood shit ain't passed down through blood
It's a dub on that
We get government aid
Spend it at they stores, puttin' they kids through college
We need balance, so we can lease and own Ds in our projects
So I'm askin' Gs to go in their pockets
The racial economic inequality, let's try to solve it My signature fade with the Bevel blade
That's a major key
I told her she smart and loyal, I like that
That's a major key
Start a label, run it, sign yourself
That's a major key
What Tony had on the table
It's like us, we a major key Still underestimated, every mistake a lesson
Mercury retrograde, so if that planet spin backwards up in the heavens maybe
It's effectin' back on niggas who don't be reppin' lately
I'm playin' chess with babies
Niggas is nursery
Niggas impersonatin', rehearsin' me
Nothin' like me, I'm the first of me and that's quite certainly
So official, come get this issue, some women crazy
I like a woman to show me wisdom
These hoes easily convinced to pop their pussy with a loaded pistol
Y'all ain't meant to be played
Says the brother with the signature fade
Still paid, stackin', new stash
Went from hangin' with shooters and clappers
To computer hackers
Check the fashion in Monaco
Gettin' ocean mist on my HSTRY hats
Khaled called me when I was in album mode
So I put it on hold for the Major Key
My album done, niggas, wait and see Classic shit, timeless, forever, iconic My signature fade with the Bevel blade
That's a major key
I told her she smart and loyal, I like that
That's a major key
Start a label, run it, sign yourself
That's a major key
What Tony had on the table
It's like us, we a major key Another one

Come to the winners circle, a lot of men will hurt you
But I'm here to nurture, I wanna take you further
She got all them purses, I say in my verses
YSL and Hermes and barely scratch the surface
She know on purpose, as I peel the curtains

Ran away with his money just to chill on the Island
All my bitches is stylin'

Fuck with me baby, it's Tunechi baby
Buss a nut, smoke a blunt, now I'm rejuvenated
With all that pink on, bitch I'm King Kong
I eat her ice cream, she eat my ice cream cone
Pop a pill and pop that pussy

And she kiss me on my neck and she kiss me on my chest

One shot, two shots, I'm gone
Now we gon' get fucked up, no excuses no apologies Keep your circle tight
Trust no one, nobody (nobody, nobody, no no no)
DJ Khaled! Gotta be careful who you trusting
Be aware of your surrounding when you hustling
Them niggas smiling at you ain't your friends, dawg
All the real ones are dead or in the pen y'all
You fuck with dude, he your day one
Almost had it all then the day comes
When they walking through your house with the strap out
Pointing at your head, got the bread then you black out (yeah)
Bright lights down the hallways
Left his best friend for dead for the small wage (ay)
They say that every dogs got a day coming
It's like he seen a ghost but he ain't say nothing
Eyes wide shut like you looking at me
Window pain to the soul say they niggas happy
But the pictures ain't say them words and we dry stomach
The homie didn't keep it one hundred
The cops doing roundups, say they got a suspect
Finally got a name now, I'm still thinkin fuck that (fuck, that)
For money, niggas murder what they close to (get this nigga)
Entire families these mother fuckin' ghost you
Smoke you, was it worth what the life was?
Just prepared for the payback because it strikes cuz
Was it worth what that life was?
Prepare for the payback when it strikes cuz Cuz when you need it the most ain't no one ever around
Cold world, cold world Yo, the pain's unbearable, remains unaware-able
He fuck around jump off a building if you dare him to
The greats they done already killed him, who you compare him to
Figure out what he said will take a year or two
Family over everything, skills over politics
He don't need the accolades as long as you acknowledge it
Just playing the hand you was dealt, no aces
Betrayal is worse than death in most cases
The world is filled with hypocrites that's so racist
Multiple shots to the face, No chasers
Mad cause you blew up quick and you excited
Your man that you grew up with get you indicted
This was your nigga, yo, for him you let the trigger go
Found out at the trial they got audio and video
Shit don't always happen how you plan it
Get jammed up and really find out who your fam is
You could feel the picture, you don't need to see the canvas
That nigga Jay'll Hawk you, he don't even play for Kansas
You know when it's someone you love the hurt's pure
You front tryna hold it in, it hurts more
He was right there back-to-back with me, my first war
Even had a crack spot together, the first floor
Used to buzz em in then meet him right by the first door
That was 'prolly a year before I went on my first tour
Friendship was worth more than a couple of ounces
He was 'sposed to be with me arguing with the bouncers
Instead you ended up somewhere far in the mountains
Talking 'about what we was doing, what we was counting
Nothing but old pictures of old sixes
Old BM's with the kids, old snitches
Two sides, both wishes
Karma is the sister of life, they both bitches See there's a story in my life
There's a story in my pain
There's a story in my tears, oh-oh oh
There's a story in me Yeah, for life
Lord forgive me for my sins, I was chasin' ends
And I'm into makin' money, I ain't in to making friends
Cause these niggas rattin', I ain't finna take a chance
Homie said he 'bout that action they grabbin' me take the stand, damn
Say loyalty make a man, got a homie and he told
I don't even shake his hand, I don't even crack a smile
Knew him since a child, man this game so foul
But niggas made vows to a code I never break
Ridin' in the heavy weight
Thirty-six O's in the bird, call it feather weight
Never on time, when I show up I be ready late
Niggas got fat while we starved they already ate
And I'm trying to get full, masks on clips full
If he got the money we attack him like a pitbull
We sellin' soft, we sellin' hard like it's a brick store
On my dick, nigga, thought that's what your bitch for
Hah! My pain ain't never been told (ain't never been told)
All the success that I'm suffering from
Came from this knowledge I sold (this knowledge I sold)
My family fucks with me
And fought the enemy that stood in my way (my way)
That's why I don't trust nobody
And I doubt you'll ever see that day
Where I surrender to you (surrender), surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you, surrender to you
Which I will never do 'Cause when you need it the most ain't no one ever around (nobody's around)
Cold world (cold world), cold world (mmm, yes it is, yeah)
And the ones that you keep close are the ones will take you down (always take you down)
Cold world (cold), a cold cold world Where I surrender to you, (surrender) surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you, surrender to you
Where I surrender to you, (surrender) surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you, surrender to you
Which I will never do
Oh-oh oh whoa
Oh-oh (oh-oh) oh-oh See there's a story in my life (Surrender)
There's a story in my pain (Surrender)
There's a story in my tears (Surrender)
There's a story in me (I won't Surrender, I won't surrender, oh no no no) [Repeat: x4]
I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from I do it for the hood cause the hood told me I could If the they hatin' on you don't stress
Tell them niggas that we the best (Fuck nigga you can't stop this)
Fuck the best we run this game
Kanye West Khaled and Pain [Chorus]
If you could you would get rid of me
What you gonna do when a nigga got to go hard
But I won't let you get to me
You should already figure I'ma go hard
If you were as real as me
You would never let another nigga step in your yard
Makin' money ain't shit to me
This in my veins and it gets to my heart
So I am, I will, I gots to go
You got another way to live you gots to go on
I am gettin' it in until the end I got to go, go, go, go hard [Kanye West]
I go the hardest
Flow so retard
I'm disgusted with myself
I mean ugh were do I start
First I stand around and vomit
Then I shit up on it
Fuck the beat up so bad
Won't no body get up on it

Nigga how sick
Sea sick
Got your hand out don't look at me bitch
You lookin' at who made me rich
You lookin' at who made me rich

Just a life of a god damn boss's
With the top off lookin' for a girl with a ass as fat as Tracy Ross's
This is dope as is get

Fly as 57 passenges
This finna' be another classic bitch
Everybody know I got if you want it then get at it
But I ain't goin' have it
No I ain't goin' have it [Chorus] [Kanye West]
I ain't never been scared
Never been a type to bite my words
When I came up ya'll gave me shit
Now I'm finna make ya'll eat them turds
Always said what the fuck I felt
Goin' head spit that murder I wrote
Man I don't care what you felt fuck you nigga I know I'm dope
Dope like I'm comin' to get my all
Felt like I had to play the fly on the wall
Felt like niggas was stuntin' on me
Funny how I'm flyer then them all
Now I'm at the top ain't know where to go now
Instead of men she goin' go down
Maybe I would of slowed down if I knew what I know now
I'm Scooby I know I'm dumb
It cud get fuckin' old but it's good I'm young
But my heart get cold as the hood I'm from
Tell me what it take to be number one
I guess it's gon be what it's goin' be
But here's one thing you got to hear
I'm a tell you like George Bush told me
Fuck yall niggas I'm out of here [Chorus] [Repeat: x4]
I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in I go hard, for the hood

I go hard for the ghetto

Two cups of Styrofoam, excuse me little mama
I can hold you down, be your friend and your lover
You want watches, new Versaces, you want Celine
Top back, screamin' money ain't a ting Seen the two G-wagons in my driveway
Facetime, two black bottles by my fireplace
Fell out with your peoples so you took the pictures down
Instagram ain't been the same since you so distant now
Took you shopping in other places that I won't name

I laughed my ass off on my way here nigga
Bentyaga with the brain bust open
That new Mulsanne got the brain bust open
Play them racks like Jimi Hendrix on the guitar
Load my gun cock it back then I push start
I can't name how many times they tried to clone me
I can't name all the names that tried to clone me
This dirty money help me see the devil
Sadity thots, know they ain't forever
My trials and tribulations playing out on blogs
Spent three hundred thousand or better that's on all the cars
That Maybach park itself, nigga
That range rover came with steps, nigga
Electric tables in the back I'm eating filet mignon
He been .44'ing all year I put the Rollie on
Trapping good all year put the Rollie on
They parading in the streets you gotta keep a drum
Said a prayer for my young nigga, know he dumb
The murder rate going up nigga, I done ran this check up nigga
Get hit up from the neck up nigga, yeah
The Goyard looking like a graveyard
Murder money, I'm in love with murder money
Old friends of me turned into my enemy
My money and fame changes niggas into enemies
All my hard work and lonely nights no sympathy
Want to send a hit but too far in the industry
I feel your energy I know you niggas envy me
They rep the gang that bangin' it out in penitentiary
I watch the shit come out your mouth and it's finicky
I'm tryna love you but I doubt I'll scream infinity
With these billions on my mind it's hard to be cohesive
Gettin' that A-Rod money like I hit the needle
Keep a Spanish mamacita like a Fanta liter
And I gave 'em all dope and they pissed off
Got my lil Haiti babies waiting so they can wack ya
I got my Memphis ten niggas waiting to jack ya
I got some DC niggas waiting to kidnap ya
I got the clappers, finessers, and the trappers
Before the rap shit, you gotta go dap 'em
Don't forget to look a nigga when they after ya I told Future I can see the future
Told my bitch I love you 'fore I knew you
I know I'm blessed nigga Hallelujah
I'm grateful and if you diss me then I might shoot ya
Brrr you don't fuck with me the feeling mutual
Fuck you, half these rap niggas owe the jeweler (fuck 'em)
I was selling keys to success
I was coppin' keys outta Texas
New Wraith with the stars in it
New Porsche, condo, living room cars in it
Ace of Spades with the Percocet and bars in it
Real soldiers, young shooters put they heart in it
They talk 'bout all this money we make and all these niggas they hatin'
Let's talk 'bout runnin' that bag up fast 'cause we ain't got no patience
Let's talk 'bout poppin' strips and xans like we 're patients
And the fed's allegations have you pacin'
Million dollar dope boy I gotta be grateful
You tryna get that 100 mil I'mma race you
Dope boy, I ain't never wanna be a rap nigga
Billboard reporter "LA Reid just sign a trap nigga"
New York Times read "Jay Z just signed a trap nigga"
Kitchen like "it's Thursday, you heard?" Might bring it back nigga
You fuckin' the money up if I'm being honest
Gotta be grateful I never break the promise
I know my plug love me, I know my bitch hate me
I heard my hood salty I tried to tell 'em it ain't my fault
It's just my blessings called me
But since they hatin' on an nigga I'mma keep ballin'
And I ain't textin' that bitch back because she keep stallin'
If she ain't fuck the first night then she just miss her callin'
Fuck a plea, I'm goin' to trial poker face I'm all in
Patek Philippe, the AP, 40 mil I'm all in
Plug hit my line I act like I ain't see 'em callin'
I work so hard for mine I'm tryna get some free bands (like Future)

We The Best Music
DJ Khaled Please, Khaled, don't pair me or compare me
Unless the said party is a rare breed
The stories I hear, they tend to mirror me
At this point now, rap is only therapy
President Push, I'm more Eric B
I ain't no joke, check out my melody
Felony, felony, felony, that's all they selling me
But 2 million in large bills is billing me
I was on the wrong side of the law
Like Pac was on the wrong side of the car
Like B.I.G. at the Soul Train Awards
The moral is all grace been driven
G Wagons are bulletproof
The ones before me got snatched like bullet tooth
Tony nigga, only one left from the drug era
The jewelry weighs more in the drug mirror Yeah, what you see when you look in the mirror, nigga? Haha
Yeah, I know who the fuck I am Yuugh, tell me how you fit in
Was you a street nigga when Nas said it's written
When Reasonable Doubt dropped, how was you living?
I was leading up the grinding in my kitchen
Getting work from Detroit like a piston
We was on a mission, stuff it in a Michelin
I could spend a year reminiscing
The length of your career, reminiscing
We can't occupy the same space
We ain't even running the same race
When it come to these bitches, it ain't the same chase
Moynat versus lean, we ain't the same taste
Therefore, it's no comparison
To be mentioned with you niggas is embarrassing
I am one Joe blow, you know my narrative
Clear your sinus like Claritin
Push When you look in the mirror, what do you see, nigga?
'Cause I know when I look in the mirror, I know what I see
You peasants don't deserve my presence You portraying other individuals
Me, I'm just weighing my residuals
From where success is the bare minimal
You a rapper, I'm a criminal
I had money before they found y'all
That's why I feel funny around y'all
Lord, bless those praying for my downfall
If I get too deep, don't let me drown, y'all
Hearing 'em talking 'bout how to flip a key
Started moving that Daddy Kane and Nicky D
Had the whole YPD sick of me
Don't sit, if you get tired, just pick a knee
Bet it all or bet it large
Now the coke or these pills, the crack, all these credit cards
I just laughed and I shrug at it
'Cause the niggas with the money are the drug addicts

All them swipers gettin' it how it come (Yep)
43, morally ambiguous, you serious?
Gettin' it, lyricist, idiots, you ain't nearin' this

After they use you, then they abuse you
Then they get mad when they lose you

You know the liar will accuse you
You know the queen still reign, it's just business as usual

Champagne out of a can would be the fly sh!t
And I'm a history major
Hood motivational speaker
Rap Led Zeppelin, best dressed list
Show you how to bubble off of large investments

I need a vasectomy
They resurrected me
But nothing is left for me
Just when you thought you'd seen the best of me

Sip more wine than a Somalian
Get around town in a private Lear
And by sun down, I'm up out of here It's still Nasty, bone in the flesh

Emerald ring, I chase cheddar mean
Pockets on swole since eighteen years old
Gettin' my dough, cigars are hand-rolled
From Guantanamo, Gallardo's, the car shows

Braveheart general since 9-4
Got the belt to show
Certified classic

Hey, yeah (we the best) All I do is win win win no matter what

Up down, up down, up down
'Cause all I do is win win win
And if you goin' in put your hands in the air
Make 'em stay there (Luda!)
Ludacris goin' in on the verse
Cause I never been defeated and I won't stop now
Keep your hands up get 'em in the sky for the homies
That didn't make it and the folks locked down
I never went no where
But they saying Luda's back
Blame it on that Conjure
The hood call it Luda-Yac
And I'm on this foolish track, so I spit my foolish flow
My hands go up and down like strippers booty's go
My verses still be serving, tight like a million virgins
Last time on a Khaled remix, now I'm on the original version
Can't never count me out
Y'all better count me in
Got twenty bank accounts, accountants count me in
Make millions every year, the south's champion
Cause all I do, all I, all I, all I
All I do is All I do is win win win no matter what

Up down, up down, up down
'Cause all I do is win win win
And if you goin' in put your hands in the air
Make 'em stay there Swerving in my lo-lo,
Head on the swivel
You know serving me's a no no
Clean as a whistle as I pull out in my Rolls Royce
Yellow bone passenger they see it, they say oh boy!
Tell Khaled back it up, my n****s call me Loco
Down for armed trafficking, don't make me pull that fo-fo
Ask you what you laughing at
Represent that mud life (mud life)
Dirty money b**** you better get your mug right (mug right)

You riding or what (what!)
'Cause we riding tonight (night!)
Now she riding with me cause you wasn't ridin' her right, All I do is win win win no matter what

Up down, up down, up down
'Cause all I do is win win win
And if you goin' in put your hands in the air
Make 'em stay there Heat in the kitchen, pot on the stove
Water getting boiled, dope being sold
Snoopy in the hoopty, system overload
I've been runnin' this rap game since I was twenty years old
I hung with the worst of 'em
Bust till I burst on 'em
Floss 'em up, toss 'em up, Hardaway, cross 'em up
Pardon me I'm bossin' up, pressure up, bless ya bruh
Don't mess with us
We like the "U" in the 80's
Back to back set a trap
Hit the lick, get it back
Hit the trick, jump the track
B**** I want my money back
Time and time again while I'm sipping on this gin
Al Davis said it best, just win baby win All I do is win win win no matter what
Got money on my mind I can never get enough
And every time I step up in the buildin'
Everybody hands go up

Lonely man, remember bein' my only fan

Blood in the soil is over oil
Cold-hearted, my blood boils
The spoils of war are used to take the drugs out the foil
Man these arms can't reach you, AR's won't recoil
Goddamn, I might marry a heiress and move to Paris
Fuck the carriage baby, let's go disappear and just perish
Thirty karats in the gold
I wear it to cherish the kings from which we inherit
My chariot is McLaren
It's all numeric
Talkin' numbers, you incoherent
Don't be embarrassed, I blame your parents for even caring
Or not aborting, ah fuck it, it's not important
My vital organs can't even tell if it's night or morning
Final warning, final warning, final warning
Every morning you'll awake and await mourning
We earn it then we burn it to ash
I call it urn money
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your voice is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you
Jolene He talks about you in his sleep
And there's nothing I can do to keep
From crying when he calls your name
Jolene And I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me
Jolene Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can You could have your choice of men
But I could never love again
He's the only one for me

My happiness depends on you
And whatever you decide to do
Jolene Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him even though you can
Jolene, Jolene (Dolly Parton) If I should stay
I would only be in your way
So I'll go, and but I know
I'll think of you each step of my way
And I will always love you
I will always love you Bitter-sweet memories
That's all I am taking with me
Good-bye, oh, please don't cry
We both know that I'm not
What you need
But I will always love you
I will always love you And I hope life, will treat you kind
And I hope that you have all
That you ever dreamed of
Oh, I do wish you joy
And I wish you happiness
But above all this
I wish you love
I will always love I will always, always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you (Dolly Parton) The hills were alive with wildflowers
And I was as wild, even wilder than they
For at least I could run, they just died in the sun
And I refused to just wither in place Just a wild mountain rose, needing freedom to grow
So I ran fearing not where I'd go
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow And the flowers I knew in the fields where I grew
Were content to be lost in the crowd
They were common and close, I had no room for growth
And I wanted so much to branch out So I uprooted myself from my home ground and left
Took my dreams and I took to the road
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow I grew up fast and wild and I never felt right
In a garden so different from me
I just never belonged, I just longed to be gone
So the garden, one day, set me free I hitched a ride with the wind and since he was my friend
I just let him decide where I'd go
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow Just a wild rambling rose, seeking mysteries untold
No regret for the path that I chose
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow Wildflowers don't care where they grow
Wildflowers don't care where they grow Tumble outta bed and I stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
Yawn and stretch and try to come to life
Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin'
Out on the street the traffic starts jumpin'
With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5 Workin' 9 to 5, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, for service and devotion
You would think that I would deserve a fat promotion
Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me! They let you dream just to watch 'em shatter
You're just a step on the boss-man's ladder
But you got dreams he'll never take away
You're in the same boat with a lotta your friends
Waitin' for the day your ship'll come in
An' the tide's gonna turn and it's all gonna roll your way Workin' 9 to 5, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and you never get the credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, yeah they got you where they want you
There's a better life, and you dream about it, don't you?
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life puttin' money in his wallet 9 to 5, whoa what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it 9 to 5, yeah they got you where they want you
There's a better life, and you dream about it, don't you?
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life puttin' money in his wallet 9 to 5, working 9 to 5 Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your voice is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you
Jolene He talks about you in his sleep
And there's nothing I can do to keep
From crying when he calls your name
Jolene And I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me
Jolene Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can You could have your choice of men
But I could never love again
He's the only one for me
Jolene I had to have this talk with you
My happiness depends on you
And whatever you decide to do
Jolene Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him even though you can

It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life puttin' money in his wallet Back through the years I go wonderin' once again
Back to the seasons of my youth
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us
And how my momma put the rags to use There were rags of many colors and every piece was small
And I didn't have a coat and it was way down in the fall
Momma sewed the rags together sewin' every piece with love
She made my coat of many colors that I was so proud of As she sewed, she told a story from the Bible, she had read
About a coat of many colors Joseph wore and then she said
"Perhaps this coat will bring you good luck and happiness"
And I just couldn't wait to wear it and momma blessed it with a kiss My coat of many colors that my momma made for me
Made only from rags but I wore it so proudly Although we had no money oh I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors my momma made for me So with patches on my britches, holes in both my shoes
In my coat of many colors I hurried off to school
Just to find the others laughing and making fun of me
and my coat of many colors my momma made for me And oh I couldn't understand that for I thought I was rich
And then I told them of the love my momma sewed in every stitch
And I told 'em all the story momma told me while she sewed
And why my coat of many colors was worth more than all their clothes They didn't understand it and I tried to make them see
One is only poor only if you choose to be It is true we had no money but I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors momma made for me
Made just for me I could hold out my arms, say "I love you this much"
I could tell you how long I will long for your touch
How much and how far would I go to prove
The depth and the breadth of my love for you? From here to the moon and back
Who else in this world will love you like that?
Love everlasting, I promise you that
From here to the moon and back
From here to the moon and back I want you to know you can always depend
On promises made and love without end
No need to wonder how faithful I'll be
Now and on into eternity From here to the moon and back
Who else in this world will love you like that?
Forever and always, I'll be where you're at
From here to the moon and back
From here to the moon and back I would blow you a kiss from the star where I sat
I would call out your name to echo through the vast
Thank heaven for you and to God, tip my hat
From here to the moon and back
And I'll spend forever just proving that fact
From here to the moon and back From here to the moon and back... Love is like a butterfly
As soft and gentle as a sigh
The multicolored moods of love are like it's satin wings
Love makes your heart feel strange inside
It flutters like soft wings in flight
Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing
I feel it when you're with me
It happens when you kiss me
That rare and gentle feeling that I feel inside
Your touch is soft and gentle
Your kiss is warm and tender
Whenever I am with you I think of butterflies Love is like a butterfly
The multicolored moods of love are like it's satin wings
Love makes your heart feel strange inside
It flutters like soft wings in flight
Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing Your laughter brings me sunshine
Everyday is spring time
And I am only happy when you are by my side
How precious is this love we share
How very precious, sweet and rare
Together we belong like daffodils and butterflies Love is like a butterfly
As soft and gentle as a sigh
The multicolored moods of love are like it's satin wings
Love makes your heart feel strange inside
It flutters like soft wings in flight
Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing (Dolly Parton/Porter Wagoner) Oh, the pain of loving you
Oh, the misery I go through
Never knowing what to do
Oh, the pain of loving you You just can't stand to see me happy
Seems you hurt me all you can
Still I go on loving you
But I never understand To love and hate at the same time
The line between the two is fine
The two have bound me heart and soul
So strong that I can't let you go To love and hate at the same time
The line between the two is fine
The two have bound me heart and soul
So strong that I can't let you go Baby, when I met you there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside, there was somethin' going on
You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
Every beat of my heart
We got somethin' goin' on
Tender love is blind
It requires a dedication
All this love we feel
Needs no conversation
We ride it together, ah-ah
Makin' love with each other, ah-ah Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in-between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, ah-ah
From one lover to another, ah-ah I can't live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothin' if you got no one
And you did walk in tonight
Slowly losing sight of the real thing But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing No more will you cry
Baby, I will hurt you never
We start and end as one, in love forever
We can ride it together, ah-ah
Makin' love with each other, ah-ah
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in-between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, ah-ah
From one lover to another, ah-ah Sail away
Oh, come sail away with me Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in-between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, ah-ah
From one lover to another, ah-ah Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in-between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, ah-ah
From one lover to another, ah-ah (Dolly Parton/Porter Wagoner) Please, please don't stop loving me
For I couldn't live with you gone
Please, please don't stop loving me
For I couldn't make it alone
You bring me the sunshine when none is in sight
And when I'm in darkness, you bring me the light
You opened my eyes when I couldn't see
So please, oh, please don't stop loving me You're my inspiration, my purpose in life
When things go all wrong, you make them all right
I would be useless if you ever leave
So please, oh please don't stop loving me Please, please don't stop loving me
For I couldn't live with you gone
Please, please don't stop loving me
For I couldn't make it alone
Please, please don't stop loving me An acre of diamonds I'd offer to you
A solid gold mansion, an airplane or two
This whole world would be yours to have and to hold
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold
I'd have all the riches my pockets would hold
I'd be, oh, so wealthy with treasures untold
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold The tears that have fallen won't buy you a thing
The heartaches you've caused me won't pay for a ring
The love that I wanted would not have grown cold
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold
I'd have all the riches my pockets would hold
I'd be, oh, so wealthy with treasures untold
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold But teardrops aren't pennies
And heartaches aren't gold (Dolly Parton) Little sparrow, little sparrow
Precious fragile little thing
Little sparrow, little sparrow
Flies so high and feels no pain
All ye maidens hede my warning
Never trust the hearts of men
They will crush you like a sparrow
Leaving you to never mend
They will vow to always love you
Swear no love but yours will do
Then they'll leave you for another
Break your little heart in two Little sparrow, little sparrow
Precious fragile little thing
Little sparrow, little sparrow
Flies so high and feels no pain If I were a little sparrow
O'er these mountains I would fly
I would find him,yes I would find him
Look into his lying eyes
I would flutter all around him
On my little sparrow wings
I would ask him, yes I would ask him
Why he let me love in vain I am not a little sparrow
I am just the broken dream
Of a cold false-hearted lover
And his evil cunning scheme Little sparrow, little sparrow
Precious fragile little thing
Little sparrow, little sparrow
Flies so high and feels no pain All ye maidens fair and tender
Never trust the hearts of men
They will crush you like a sparrow
Leaving you to never mend Little sparrow, little sparrow
Oh the sorrow never ends Sometimes I try to count the ways and reasons that I love you
But I can't ever seem to count that far
I love you in a million ways and for a million reasons
More than this I love you as you are
More than this I love you as you are You are my inspiration, you are the song I sing
You are what makes me happy, you are my everything
You are my daily sunshine, you are my ev'ning star
Ev'rything I'll ever need or want, that's what you are
Ev'rything I'll ever need or want is what you are You are my thoughts when I'm awake, my dreams when I'm asleep
You are the reason for my smile, you are the words I speak
Every role I play in life you play the leading part
Ev'rything I'd ever hope to find is what you are
Ev'rything I'd ever hope to find is what you are You are my inspiration, you are the song I sing
You are what makes me happy, you are my everything
You are my daily sunshine, you are my ev'ning star
Ev'rything I'll ever need or want, that's what you are
Ev'rything I'll ever need or want is what you are You are...
You are Those memories of you still haunt me
Every night when I lay down
I'll always love you, little darling
Until the day they lay me down In dreams of you, my body trembles
I wake up and call your name
But you're not there, and I'm so lonesome
Without your love I'd go insane Those memories of you still haunt me
Every night when I lay down
I'll always love you, little darling
Until the day they lay me down I close my eyes and you're there with me
Your kiss I feel, your face I see
It's not your lips now that drive me crazy
It's just your haunting memory Those memories of you still haunt me
Every night when I lay down
I'll always love you, my little darling
Until the day they lay me down
Until the day they lay me down Peace in the valley for me some day Well, I'm tired and so weary, but I must travel on
'Til the Lord comes and calls me away, oh, yes
Where the morning's so bright and the Lamb is the light
And the night is as bright as the day, oh, yes There will be peace in the valley for me some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh, Lord, I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow, no trouble I see
Only peace in the valley for me, oh, yes Well, the bear will be gentle and the wolves will be tame
And the lion shall lay down by the lamb, oh, yes
And the beasts from the wild shall be led by a little child
And I'll be changed, changed from this creature that I am, oh, yes There will be peace in the valley for me some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh, Lord, I pray
And there'll be no sadness and no sorrow, no trouble I see
Only will be peace in the valley for me, oh, yes
Yes, there will be peace, sweet peace in the valley for me, oh, yes Du-u-u Du-u-u Du-u-u-u-u-u wa Du-u wa My love for you is deeper than the depths of any ocean,
And as faithful as the stars that grace the night,
As constant as the sun making its journey through heavens,
and we'll always be together you and I. --
[Chorus]
Together you and I can stop the rain and make the sun shine.
Paint a pretty rainbow, brushed with love across the sky,
Together you and I belong, like a songbird and a song
and we'll always be together you and I
-- Life with you is sweeter than the fragrance of the flowers
And as happy as the laughter of a child
As peaceful as a river and as lasting as forever
you know we'll always be together you and I [Chorus] I always be beside or close behind you.
Wherever you go, you'll always know I'll always find you [Chorus] We'll always be together, you and I Forever together, forever you and I
(forever you and I du-du)
Forever together, together you and I will always be
(together, together)
Together, you and I........ You say tomorrow you're going
It's so hard for me to believe
I'm making plans for the heartaches
'Cause you're making plans to leave The tears for me will be falling
Like a tree shedding its leaves
I'm making plans for the tear drops
'Cause you're making plans to leave You're making plans to forget me
I'm making plans to miss you
I'm getting ready to grieve I'm making plans to be lonesome
'Cause you're making plans to leave I'm making plans to be lonesome
'Cause you're making plans to leave I'm making plans to be lonesome
'Cause you're making plans to leave Oh, sometimes I go walking through fields where we walked
Long ago in the sweet used to be
And the flowers still grow, but they don't smell as sweet
As they did when you picked them for me Chorus: And when I think of you and the love we once knew
How I wish we could go back in time
Do you ever think back on old memories at all
Or do I ever cross your mind Do you ever wake up lonely in the middle of the night
Because you miss me, do you darling
Oh, and do your memories ever take
You back into another place in time
Oh, do you ever miss the feelings
And the love we shared when you were with me, do you darling
I just wonder do I cross your mind Oh, how often I wish that again I could kiss
Your sweet lips like I did long ago
And how often I long for those two loving arms
That once held me so gentle and close Chorus: And when I think of you and the love we once knew
How I wish we could go back in time
Do you ever recall these old memories at all
Or do I ever cross your mind Do you ever ... (Floyd Parton) I'll do everything I can to make you proud to be my man
And I'll fulfill all your fantasies
I guess we're promising a lot, but for now it's all we've got
And I'll stand by you through our rockin' years Rockin' chairs, rockin' babies, rock-a-bye, rock of ages
Side by side we'll be together always
And if you'll hold me tight when you love me
That's all I'll ask of you
And I'll stand by you through our rockin' years I'll be your friend, I'll be your lover
Until the end, there'll be no other
'Cause my heart has only room for one
Yes, I'll always love you, and I'll always be here for you
And I'll stand by you through our rockin' years Rockin' chairs, rockin' babies, rock-a-bye, rock of ages
Side by side we'll be together always
And if you'll hold me tight when you love me
That's all I'll ask of you
And I'll stand by you through our rockin' years Rockin' chairs, rockin' babies, rock-a-bye, rock of ages
Side by side, we'll be together always
And, yes, I'll always love you and I'll always be here for you
And I'll stand by you through our rockin' years, and I'll be here
And I'll stand by you through our rockin' years Through our rockin' years I want to feel this way
Longer than time
I want to know your dreams
And make them mine
I want to change the world
Only for you
All the impossible
I want to do I want to hold you close under the rain
I want to kiss your smile
And feel your pain
I know what's beautiful
Looking at you
Here in a world of lies
You are the true [Chorus:]
And baby
Everytime you touch me
I become a hero
I'll make you safe no matter where you are
And bring you
Anything you ask for
Nothing is above me
I'm shining like a candle in the dark
When you tell me that you love me I want to make you see
Just what i was
Show you the loneliness
And what it does
You walked into my life
To stop my tears
Everything's easy now
I have you here [Repeat chorus]
In a world without you
I would always hunger
All i need is your love to make me stronger [Repeat chorus] (Dolly Parton) Sittin' on the front porch on a summer afternoon
In a straightback chair on two legs, leans against the wall
Watch the kids a' playin' with June bugs on a string
And chase the glowin' fireflies when evenin' shadows fall In my Tennessee mountain home
Life is as peaceful as a baby's sigh
In my Tennessee mountain home
Crickets sing in the fields near by Honeysuckle vine clings to the fence along the lane
Their fragrance makes the summer wind so sweet
And on a distant hilltop, an eagle spreads it's wings
An' a songbird on a fence post sings a melody In my Tennessee mountain home
Life is as peaceful as a baby's sigh
In my Tennessee mountain home
Crickets sing in the fields near by Walkin' home from church on a Sunday with the one ya' love
Just laughin', talkin', making future plans
And when the folks ain't lookin', you might steal a kiss or two
Sittin' in the porch swing, holdin' hands In my Tennessee mountain home
Life is as peaceful as a baby's sigh
In my Tennessee mountain home
Crickets sing in the fields near by (Dolly Parton/Carl Perkins) When it's family, you forgive them for they know not what they do
When it's family, you accept them, 'cause you have no choice but to
When it's family, they're a mirror of the worst and best in you
And they always put you to the test
And you always try to do your best
And just pray for God to do the rest, when it's family Some are preachers, some are gay
Some are addicts, drunks and strays
But not a one is turned away, when it's family
Some are lucky, others ain't
Some are fighters, others faint
Winners, losers, sinners, saints, it's all family And when it's family you trust them and your heart's an open door
When it's family, you tolerate what you'd kill others for
When it's family, you love and hate and take, then give some more
Somehow you justify mistakes, try to find some better way
To solve the problems day to day, in the family You take the trouble as it comes and love them more than anyone
Good or bad or indifferent, it's still family
You choose your lovers, you pick your friends
Not the family that you're in, nah
They'll be with you 'til the end, 'cause it's family And when it's family, you forgive them for they know not what they do
When it's family, they're a mirror of the worst and best in you
When it's family, when it's family
Let me be all that I should be to the family (Dolly Parton) Well a good ways down the railroad track
There was this little old rundown shack
And in it lived a man I'd never seen
Folks said he was a mean and a vicious man
And you better not set foot on his land
I didn't think nobody could be that mean
So I took me out walking down the railroad track
I was a-gonna go down to that little old shack
And just find out if all them things I'd heard was true
There was a big black dog laying out in the yard
And it growled at me and I swallowed hard
And I heard somebody say well who are you
Oh and there he stood in the door of that shack
His beard and his hair was long and black
And he was the biggest man I'd ever seen
When he spoke his voice was low and deep
But he just didn't frighten me
'Cause somehow I just knew he wasn't mean
He said what you doing snooping 'round my place
And I saw a smile come across his face
So I smiled back and I told him who I was
He said come on in and pull you up a chair
You might as well since you already here
And he said you can call me Joshua
Joshua Joshua
Whatcha doing living here all alone
Joshua Joshua
Ain't you got nobody to call your own
No no no no We talked 'til the sun was clean out of sight
And we still talking when it come daylight
And there was just so much we had to say hey
I'd spent my life in an orphan's home
And just like him I was all alone
So I said yeah when he asked if I'd stay
Oh we grew closer as time went on
And that little old shack it was a happy home
And we just couldn't help but fall in love
That big black dog and that little old shack
Sitting down by the railroad track
It's plenty good enough for me and Joshua Joshua Joshua
Why you're just what I've been looking for
Joshua Joshua
You ain't gonna be lonesome anymore
No no Yodel-a-he-ho Me and Joshua
Me and Joshua
Me and Joshua yeah yeah
Me and Joshua (Dolly Parton) Take my hand and run with me
Out of the past of yesterday
And walk with me into the future of tomorrow
Yesterday must be forgot
No looking back no matter what
There's nothing there but mem'ries that bring sorrow Yesterday is gone, gone, but tomorrow is forever No more crying tears leave tracks
And mem'ries find their way back
Tomorrow's waiting let's journey there together Yesterday is gone, gone, but tomorrow is forever I care not for yesterday I love you as you are today
Yesterday just helped to pass the time while waiting
We must forget the passing time
My love for you is the real kind
The kind that won't hurt you, oh never Yesterday is gone, gone, but tomorrow is forever
Yesterday is gone, gone, but tomorrow is forever Well, I wish that I was on old Rocky Top
Down in the Tennessee hills
Cause there ain't no smog, no smoke on Rocky Top
Ain't no telephone bill Now but once I had me a man on Rocky Top
Half bear the other half cat
Well, he was wild as a mink but he was sweet as soda-pop
I often think about that Oh, Rocky Top, you'll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good ol' Rocky Top
Rocky Top, Tennessee, Rocky Top, Tennessee Now once two strangers climbed ol' Rocky Top
Lookin' for a moonshine still
Strangers ain't come down from Rocky Top
And some say they never will Did you know corn don't grow at all on Rocky Top?
The dirt's too rocky by far
And that's why all the folks on Rocky Top
Get their corn from a jar Oh, Rocky Top, you'll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good ol' Rocky Top
Rocky Top, Tennessee, Rocky Top, Tennessee Now I've had years of cramped up city life
Trapped luck a duck in a pen
All I know is it's a dad-burn pity
Life can't be simple again Oh, Rocky Top, you'll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good ol' Rocky Top
Rocky Top, Tennessee, Rocky Top, Tennessee Rocky Top, Tennessee
Tennessee, Rocky Top It's a lesson too late for the learning
Made of sand, made of sand
In the wink of an eye my soul is turnin'
In your hand, in your hand Are you going away
With no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace left behind
Oh i could've loved you better Didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind
As we walk along my thoughts are tumblin'
Round and round, round and round Underneath our feet are someplace rumblin'
Underground, underground
Are you going away
With no word of farewell Will there be not a trace left behind
Oh i could've loved you better
Didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind I've got reason a plenty for goin
This i know, this i know
The weeds have been steadily growin'
Please don't go, please don't go Are you going away
With no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace left behind
I could've loved you better Didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind
Are you going away
With no word of farewell Will there be not a trace left behind
Oh i could've loved you better
Didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind You know that was the last thing on my mind (Dolly Parton) Daddy was an old time preacher man
He preacher the word of God throughout the land
He preached so plain a child could understand
Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man
He told the people of he need to pray
He talked about God's wrath and judgement day
He preached about the great eternity
He preached hell so hot that you could feel the heat Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man
Aunt Leanona would get up to testify
And we'd sing "In The Sweet By And By"
The we'd sing "I'm On My Way To Canaan Land"
Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man Revivals and camp meetings went for weeks
Folks came from all around to hear him preach
Daddy said if one is saved it's worth it all
But the aisles were always filled at altar calls
Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man Daddy worked for God but asked for no pay
For he believed that God provides a way
We never had a lot but we got by
Guess it's 'cause the Lord was on Daddy's side
Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man [Spoken] I've always been misunderstood because of how I look.
Don't judge me by the cover 'cause I'm a real good book.
So read into it what you will, but see me as I am.
The way I look is just a country girl's idea of glam. I grew up poor and ragged, just a simple country girl.
I wanted to be pretty more than anything in the world,
like Barbie or the models in the Fredricks' catalog.
From rags to wishes in my dreams I could have it all.
I'm just a backwoods Barbie, too much makeup, too much hair.
Don't be fooled by thinkin' that the goods are not there.
Don't let these false eyelashes lead you to believe that
I'm as shallow as I look 'cause I run true and deep. I'm just a backwoods Barbie in a push-up bra and heels.
I might look artificial, but where it counts I'm real.
Yes, I can see where I may be misjudged upon first glance.
But even backwoods Barbies deserve a second chance. All dolled up and hopin' for a chance to prove my worth,
'Cuz even backwoods Barbie's get their feelings hurt. To know, know, know him
Is to love love love him
Just to see him smile
Makes my life worthwhile
To know know know him
Is to love love love him
And I do I'll be good to him
I'll bring love to him
Everyone says there'll come a day
When I'll walk alongside of him
Yes, just to know him
Is to love love love him
And I do Why can't he see
How blind can he be
Someday he will see
That he was meant for me, ooh To know, know, know him
Is to love love love him
Just to see him smile
Makes my life worthwhile
To know, know, know him
Is to love love love him
And I do When the mornin' sun
Streaks across my room
And I'm wakin' up
From another dream of you
Yes, you know I'm on the road
Once again it seems
All that's left behind
Is a chain of broken dreams But you know that I love you
You know that I love you
Oh, I love you And how I wish that love
Was all we'd need to live
What a life we'd have
'Cause I've got so much to give
But ya' know I feel so sad
Down inside my heart
That the dollar sign
Should be keepin' us apart But you know that I love you
You know that I love you
Oh, how I love you And if only I could find my way back to the time
When the problems of this life
Had not yet crossed my mind
And the answers could be found in children's nursery rhymes
I'd come runnin' back to you
I'd come runnin' back to you But you know we can't
Live on dreams alone
Got to pay the rent
So I must leave you all alone
'Cause you know I made my choice many years ago
And now this travelin' life
Well, it's the only life I know But you know that I love you
You know that I love you
Oh, I love you
But you know that I love you
You know that I love you
Oh, how I love you
But you know that I love you
You know that I love you
Oh, how I love you But you know I love you
But you know I love you
Oh, I love you
But you know that I love you
But you know that I love you
Oh, how I love you
But you know that I love you
But you know that I love you If she brings you happiness
Then I wish you both the best
It's your happiness that matters most of all
But if she ever breaks your heart
If the teardrops ever start
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls Though it hurts to let you go
Darling I want you to know
I'll run to you if ever you should call
And if I should ever hear
That she's made you shed a tear
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls I'll be there anytime you need me by your side
To dry away each teardrop you've cried
If she ever leaves you blue
Just remember I love you
And I'll be there
Before the next teardrop falls All I Estare Candor me necesites a tu lado
Para borrar cadda lagrima que haya llorado
If he ever leaves you blue
Just remember I love you
And I'll be there
Before the next teardrop falls I'll be there, I'll be there
Before the next teardrop falls (Dolly Parton) My life is like unto a bargain store
And I may have just what you're lookin' for
If you don't mind the fact that all the merchandise is used
But with a little mending it could be as good as new
Why you take for instance this old broken heart
If you will just replace the missing parts
You would be surprised to find how good it really is
Take it and you never will be sorry that you did The bargain store is open come inside
You can easily afford the price
Love is all you need to purchase all the merchandise
And I will guarantee you'll be completely satisfied Take these old used memories from the past
And these broken dreams and plans that didn't last
I'll trade them for a future, I can't use them anymore
I've wasted love but I still have some more The bargain store is open come inside
You can easily afford the price
Love is all you need to purchase all the merchandise
And I can guarantee you'll be completely satisfied My life is like unto a bargain store
And I may have just what you're lookin' for
If you don't mind the fact that all the merchandise is used
With a little mendin' it could be as good as new The bargain store is open, come inside
The bargain store is open, come inside There's a wreath on the door
She don't live here no more
As of today, she flew home
And we all gathered here
In sorrow and tears
It won't be the same with her gone
There's a place on the hill
That's peaceful and still
Where she'll sleep beside daddy again
The ole' family tree is shedding it's leaves
But we'll all met in heaven again Chorus: Oh, she's an angel
Let her fly, let her fly
She's gone home to glory
To her home in the sky
When God sees her comin'
Heaven's choir will smile
And sing, "oh she's an angel, let her fly, let her fly
Ooh, she's an angel, let her fly" She used to rock me when I was a child
Sing "rock of ages" and "in the sweet bye and bye"
Her life wasn't easy, oh but how hard she tried
You know she's an angel, lord, so let her fly Repeat chorus Tag: Let her fly
Ooh she's an angel, let her fly I can't forget you
Ever since the moment that I met you
You've been on my mind
And I need to somehow let you know
That I think about you all the time [Chorus:]
So when you think about love, think about me
I can give you more than you'll ever need
Sooner or later every heart needs some company
When you think about love, think about me
When you think about love, think about me We were strangers
Now I'm already wrapped around your finger
Oh what's a heart to do
'Cause it lingers
And the thought of you
Wantin' me as much as I want you [Chorus] Makes me blue
I'm not holding you tonight
'Cause only you can satisfy
This heart of mine [Chorus] Well, good morning, Captain
Good morning to you, Sir
Hey hey yeah Do you need another mule skinner
Down on your new mud run?
Hey hey yeah Yodel-a-ee-he-he
He-he-he-he-he-he Well I'm a lady mule skinner
From down old Tennessee way
Hey hey, I come from Tennessee I can make any mule listen
Or I won't accept your pay
Hey hey I won't take your pay Yodel-a-ee-he-he
He-he-he-he-he-he Well, hey hey, little water boy
Won't you bring your water 'round?
Hey hey If you don't like your job
Well, you can throw your bucket down
Throw it down boy, throw it down Yodel-a-ee-he-he
He-he-he-he-he-he Well, I've been working down in Georgia

And wanna be a mule skinner Yodel-a-ee-he-he
He-he-he-he-he-he
Yodel-a-ee-he-he
He-he-he-he-he-he
Mule skinner blues (Traditional) In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows
My love, my love, what have I done
To make you treat me so
You've caused me to weep, you've caused me to mourn
You've caused me to leave my home In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows The longest train I ever saw
Went down that Georgia Line
The engine passed at six o'clock
The caboose went by at nine In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows I asked my captain for the time of day
He said he throwed his watch away In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows
Hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo (Dolly Parton) He lived by the apple orchard in this little orchard shack
His real name was Jackson Taylor but I called him AppleJack
Now old AppleJack was loved by everyone he ever knew
AppleJack picked apples but he picked the banjo too Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song for me and I'll sing
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song, let your banjo ring Now I'd go down to AppleJack's almost everyday
We'd sit and we'd drink applejack that old AppleJack had made
Then he'd take his banjo down then he'd ask me if I'd sing
And he would play the banjo and I'd play my tambourine Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song for me and I'll sing
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song, let your banjo ring That's when I was just a kid and now that I am grown
All I have are memories, old AppleJack is gone
Oh but he left me his banjo and it always takes me back
And everytime I play it I still hear AppleJack Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song for me and I'll sing
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song, let your banjo ring Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song for me and I'll sing
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song, let your banjo ring Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song for me and I'll sing
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song, let your banjo ring It's too late
You say you want me and it's too late
Once my love for you was so great
But it's too late to love me now It's too bad
You say you need me and it's too bad
I know the feelin' and it's so sad
But it's too late to love me now
It's too late to love me now Don't you know how hard I tried
To hold out just for you?
Lovin' you from mem'ry day by day Then someone came into my life
Turned my dreams around
He's takin' all the love you threw away It's too late
You say you want me and it's too late
Once my love for you was so great
But it's too late to love me now
It's too late to love me now Don't you know how hard I tried
To hold out just for you?
Lovin' you from mem'ry day by day Then someone came into my life
Turned my world around
He's takin' all the love you threw away It's too late
You say you need me and it's too late
Once my love for you was so great
But it's too late to love me now
It's too late to love me now Two little children a boy and a girl
Sat by an old church door
The little girl's feet
Were as brown as the curl
That fell on the dress that she wore
The little boy's cloths were all tattered and torn
They shown beneath his blue eyes Why don't you go home
To you mommy I said
And this was the maddens reply
Mommy's in heaven
Angels took her away
Left Tim and I all alone
We've no one to love us
And daddy is dead
And our darling mother is gone Mommy got sick
Angels took her away
To dwell in those mansions so bright
She said she would come
For her children some day
And I guess she's coming tonight
The sexton came early
To ring the church bell
And found them
Beneath the snow white
The angels made room for the orphans to dwell
Up in heaven with their mommy that night (Dolly Parton) She's been there, God knows, she's been there
She has seen and done it all
She's a woman, she know how to
Dish it out or take it all
Her heart's as soft as feathers
Still she weathers stormy skies
And she's a sparrow when she's broken
But she's an eagle when she flies A kaleidoscope of colors
You can toss her around and round
You can keep her in you vision
But you'll never keep her down
She's a lover, she's a mother
She's a friend and she's a wife
And she's a sparrow when she's broken
But she's an eagle when she flies Gentle as the sweet magnolia
Strong as steel, her faith and pride
She's an everlasting shoulder
She's the leaning post of life
She hurts deep and when she weeps
She's just as fragile as a child
And she's a sparrow when she's broken
But she's an eagle when she flies She's a sparrow when she's broken
But she's an eagle when she flies
Oh, bless her, Lord
She's an eagle when she flies I can see you're disappointed
By the way you look at me
And I'm sorry that I'm not
The woman you thought I'd be
Yes, I've made my mistakes
But listen and understand
My mistakes are no worse than yours
Just because I'm a woman So when you look at me
Don't feel sorry for yourself
Just think of all the shame
You might have brought somebody else Just let me tell you this
Then we'll both know where we stand
My mistakes are no worse than yours
Just because I'm a woman Now a man will take a good girl
And he'll ruin her reputation
But when he wants to marry
Well, that's a different situation He'll just walk off and leave her
To do the best she can
While he looks for an angel
To wear his wedding band Now I know that I'm no angel
If that's what you thought you'd found
I was just the victim of
A man that let me down Yes, I've made my mistakes
But listen and understand
My mistakes are no worse than yours
Just because I'm a woman No, my mistakes are no worse than yours
Just because I'm a woman There's a picture that I carry
One we made some time ago
When they ask who's in the picture with me
I say just "Someone I use to know" Just someone, I used to spend some time with
Just a flame, that's lost its glow
But I don't them of the nights I cried without you
I say just "Someone I use to know" Just someone, I use to run around with
Just a friend from long ago
I don't tell them, how lost I am without you
I say just "Someone I use to know" I say just "Someone I use to know" (Dolly Parton) Momma never seemed to miss the finer things in life
If she did, she never did say so to daddy
She never wanted to be more than mother and a wife
If she did, she never did say so to daddy The only things that seemed to be important in her life
Was to make our house a home and make us happy
Momma never wanted anymore than what she had
If she did, she never did say so to daddy He often left her all alone
She didn't mind the stayin' home
If she did, she never did say so to daddy
And she never missed the flowers
And the gifts he never gave her
If she did, she never did say so to daddy Being took for granted was a thing that she accepted
And she didn't need those things to make her happy
She didn't even seem to notice
That he didn't kiss and hold her
If she did, she never did say so to daddy One morning we awoke
Just to find the note
That momma carefully wrote
And left to daddy
And as he began to read it
Our ears could not believe it
The words that she had written there to daddy She said our kids are old enough
And they don't need me very much
So I've gone in search for love I need so badly
I have needed you so long
But I just can't keep holdin' on
She never meant to come back home
If she did, she never did say so to daddy Momma's gone
Good-bye to daddy Life has dealt us our fair share of pain along the way
And many dreams have withered on the vine
But dreams are all such fleeting things and happiness is now
We'll just live our lives one day at a time In all the stormy weather love has always seen us through
Happiness is knowing that you're mine
Why worry about tomorrow for tomorrow may not come
We'll just live our lives one day at a time This one thing I'm learning you take life as it comes
Each day is just a gift so don't be blind
Tomorrow may bring gladness or a little bit of sadness
We'll just live our lives one day at a time
[ guitar ]
We may not have a fortune making plans to change the world
We may leave little marks in life's design
But as long as we're together every hour is filled with love
And we'll just live our lives one day at a time Just one thing I'm learning...
We'll just live our lives one day at a time You packed in the morning
I stared out the window
And I struggled for something to say
You left in the rain without closing the door
I didn't stand in your way
Now I miss you more
Than I missed you before
And now where I'll find comfort, god knows
'Cause you left me
Just when I needed you most
Yes, you left me
Just when I needed you most
Now most every morning
I stare out the window
I think about where you might be
I've written you letters that I'd like to send
If you would just send one to me
'Cause I need you more
Than I needed before
And now where I'll find comfort, god knows
'Cause you left me Just when I needed you most
Yes, you left me
Just when I needed you most
You packed in the morning I stared out the window
And I struggled for something to say
You left in the rain without closing the door
I didn't stand in your way Now I love you more
Than I loved you before
And now where I'll find comfort, god knows
'Cause you left me Just when I needed you most
You left me
Just when I needed you most
Oh, you left me Just when I needed you most We're holding on to nothing left to hold onto
I'm so tired of holding on to nothin'
The years have shown no kindness
For the hard times we've been through We've squeezed the life from every dream
And still go right on bluffin'
With really nothin' left to hold onto Oh, why do we keep holding on
With nothing left to hold onto
Let's be honest with each other
That's the least that we can do
I feel guilty when they envy me and you
We're holding on with nothing left to hold onto We were young and foolishly mistaken
Victims of a passion, much too strong to be denied
With only tears to show for all the years that we've been fakin'
God only knows how long, how hard we've tried Oh, why do we keep holding on
With nothing left to hold onto
Let's be honest with each other
That's the least that we can do
I feel guilty when they envy me and you
We're holding on with nothing left to hold onto We're holding on with nothing left to hold onto TIE A YELLOW RIBBON ROUND THE OLD OAK TREE

Just when I've begun to get myself together
You waltz right in the door
Just like you've done before
And wrap my heart 'round your little finger Here you come again
Just when I'm about to make it work without you
You look into my eyes and lie those pretty lies
And pretty soon I'm wond'rin how I came to doubt you. All you gotta do is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you and in a little while
You're messin' up my mind and fillin' up my senses
Here you come again lookin' better than a body has a right to
And shakin' me up so that all I really know
Is here you come again and here I go All you gotta do is smile that smile

Is here you come again, and here I go, here I go
And here I go
And here I go
Here you come again and here I go
Here I go You know I love you and I always will
I know you're married but I love you still
The day I met you my heart spoke to me
It said to love you through eternity Now knowing that you were another's bride
I vowed I'll always be close by your side
You know I love you and I always will
I know you're married but I love you still You broke a heart dear that would die for you
I'd give this world dear to belong to you
The game is over now and we've both lost
A broken heart will have to pay the cost You know I love you and I always will
I know you're married but I love you still I love you so much I can't let you go
And sometimes I believe you love me
But somewhere between your heart and mine
There's a door without any key Somewhere between your heart and mine
There's a window that I can't see through
There's a wall so high it reaches the sky
Somewhere between me and you
[ steel ]
Somewhere between your heart and mine
There's a love I can't understand
It's there for a while then it fades like a smile
And I'm left in the middle again Somewhere between your heart and mine... You can dance
Every dance with the one who gives you the eye
Let him hold you tight
You can smile
Every smile for the one that hold your hand
In the pale moonlight
Just don't forget who's takin' you home
And in who's arms you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me Oh, I know
That the music's fine like sparklin' wine
Go and have your fun
Laugh and sing
But while we're apart, don't give your heart to anyone
Just don't forget who's takin' you home
And in who's arms you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me Baby don't you know I love you so
Can't you feel it with your touch
I will never ever let you go
I love you, oh, so much You can dance
Go and carry on till the night is gone
Till it's time to go
If she asks
If you're all alone, can she take you home
You got to tell her no And don't forget who's takin' you home
And in who's arms you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me
Just don't forget who's takin' you home
And in who's arms you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me Ooh darling, save the last dance for me
You can dance
Every dance with the one who gives you the eye
Let him hold you tight
You can smile
Every smile for the one that hold your hand
In the pale moonlight
Just don't forget who's takin' you home
And in who's arms you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me
Ooh darlin', save the last dance for me
Save the last dance for me
Dance, dance, dance, dance If you go, I'll follow you
You can't leave my love behind

Even death could never end this love of mine I have loved you for so long
With a love both true and strong
You are all I'll every have
And I'll love you good or bad Where you go I'll go with you
No matter where you take me to

You can't leave my love behind
If you go (if you go) I'll follow you
Even death could never end this love of mine
If you go, I'll follow you.... With great anticipation he waited at the door
His only son was due from overseas
For months now he'd been waitin' since he'd gone off to war
And his eyes were filled with tears of great relief Welcome home, son
His loving arms held open and his heart so full of love
Welcome home, son
I've been prayin' and been hopin' and I never did give up
I knew that you'd return to me
The place where you were meant to be
Rest now, for you've been gone too long.
I hear him say as they embrace
"I've waited so long for this day
My son, my very own... Welcome home." But a dreary rain was falling while another soldier fell
And a mother wakes up crying in the night
She thought she'd heard him calling in that moment she could tell
Her only son had passed into the light Welcome home, son
His loving arems held open and his heart so full of love
Welcome home, son
As Jesus stood there glowing, their hands reached out and touched
I knew that you'd return to me
The place that you were meant to be
Rest now, for you've been gone too long
As they embraced I heard him say
"I've waited so long for this day
My son, my very own... Welcome home." Now I think of all the families that have lost a darling one
And I think how Jesus died for all our sins
And I think how much God loved us to send his only son
To live and die, and then to live again Welcome home son
I hear God saying when they nailed Christ to the cross that day
Welcome home son
And when he sent his angels to roll that stone away
I knew that you'd return to me
The place where you were meant to be
Rest now, for you've been gone too long
I hear God say as they embrace
"I've waited so long for this day
Well done my faithful son... Welcome home." Welcome home!
I hope to hear God saying when it's my time to go!
Welcome home!
While the angel band is playing and God comes to claim my soul!
The angels will be singing and joybells will be ringing!
Rejoicing! I'll shout and sing along!
When there are no more wars to fight
And we're all children of the light
When the father and the son say
"Welcome home!" Tag: Welcome home, welcome home, welcome home. You ought to go north somebody told us
'Cause the air is filled with gold dust
And fortune falls like snow flakes in your hands
Now I don't recall who said it
But we'd spent our lives on credit
And so we headed out to find our promised land Just poor Smokey Mountains farm folk
With nothing more than high hopes
So we hitched our station wagon to a star
But our dreams all fell in on us
'Cause there was no land of promise
Lord it's a struggle just keepin' sight of who you are Oh, and these northern nights are dreary
My old southern heart is weary
As I wonder how the old folks are back home
But I know that they all love me
And I know they're thinking of me
And Smokey Mountains memories keep me strong You know I've been thinkin' just a whole lot lately
About what's been and what awaits me
It takes all I've got to give what life demands
Lord, you go insane if you give in to it
Life's a mill and I've been through it
I'm just thankful I'm creative with my hands Oh, and these northern nights they're dreary
These old southern eyes are teary
As I wonder how the old folks are back home
But I'll keep leanin' on my Jesus
I know He'll love and guide and lead us
And Smokey Mountains memories keep me strong If I'll keep looking to the Father
He'll keep my heads above the water
While the Smokey Mountains memories keep me strong
My home sweet home I thought I had seen pretty girls in my time
But that was before I met you
I never saw one that I wanted for mine
But that was before I met you
I thought I was swinging the world by the tail
I thought I could never be blue
I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved
But that was before I met you I thought I'd stay single always be free
But that was before I met you
I said that no sweet thang could ever hold me
But that was before I met you I thought I was swinging the world by the tail
I thought I could never be blue
I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved
But that was before I met you That was before I met you An old man was sitting at his table one day
Writing a letter to pass time away
His little granddaughter climbed up on his knee
Saying won't you please write a letter for me
Oh, what must I say in this letter I pray
Tell mommy I miss her since she went away
I'm coming to see her real soon I hope
He chocked back a big lump that rouse in his throat He sealed it and wrote on that big envelope
To god up in heaven you'll get it I hope
He stamped it and handed it to her to mail
Her big eyes were shining, her little face pale
She was crossing the street to the box o'er the way
And when she stepped out Never looked either way
A big object hit her and sped away fast
The little girls prayers had been answered at last
The postman was passing
And picked up the note
Addressed to the master
And these words he spoke
Strait up into heave this letter did go
She's happy up there with her mommy I know (Dolly Parton) Hello you said the day we met
Handing me a yellow rose
You asked me out
And to your surprise
And to mine I said I'd go
I thought it so romantic
And I found you sweet and bold
Though we'd only met
I still said yes
To a single yellow rose And for years to come
You were the one
To sleep with me at night
To laugh and talk
And share my thoughts
And hold me when I'd cry
And on every occasion
And for no good reason to
A big bouquet or a single yellow rose
Was sent from you Yellow roses
The color of sunshine
You loved me at one time
Why did you have to go
Yellow roses
Are you sending your new love
My bright yellow rose buds
I still love you so I never see a yellow rose
That I didn't think of you
It's still my favorite flower
Though the yellow's turned to blue
The day you left my teardrops fell
Upon your farewell not
You said goodbye like you said hello
With a single yellow rose Yellow roses
The color of sunshine
You loved me at one time
Why did you have to go
Yellow roses
Are you sending your new love
My bright yellow rose buds
Oh I still love you so Yellow roses
The color of sunshine
You loved me at one time
Why did you have to go
Sweet yellow roses
Are you sending your new love
My bright yellow rose buds
I still love you so Two doors down they're laughing and drinking and having a party
And two doors down they're not aware that I'm around
Here I am crying my heart out, feeling sorry
But they're having a party just two doors down I think I'll dry these useless tears and get myself together
I think I'll wander down the hall and have a look around
'Cause I can't stay inside this lonely room and cry forever
I think I'd really rather join 'em two doors down Two doors down we're laughing and drinking and having a party
And two doors down they're all aware that I'm around
Here I am no longer crying and feeling sorry
We're having a party just two doors down I can't believe I'm standing here dry-eyed, all smiles & talkin'
Making conversation with the new love I've found
I ask him if he'd like to be alone and we start walkin'
Down the hall to my place waiting two doors down,yeah Two doors down they're laughing and drinking and having a party
And two doors down we're not aware that they're around
'Cause here I am feeling everything but sorry
We're having our own party two doors down Oh oh oh oh two doors down
Oh oh oh oh two doors down
Oh oh oh oh two doors down
Oh oh oh oh two doors down Two doors down they're laughing and drinking and having a party
And two doors down we're not aware that they're around
'Cause here I am feeling everything but sorry
We're having our own party two doors down Two doors down they're laughing and drinking and having a party
And two doors down we're not aware that they're around
Here I end feeling everything but sorry (Dolly Parton) Hello God, are you out there?
Can you hear me, are you listenin' any more?
Hello God, if we're still on speakin' terms
Can you help me like before?
I have questioned your existence,
My resistance leaves me cold
Can you help me go the distance?
Hello God, hello, hello This old world has gone to pieces
Can we fix it, is there time?
Hate and violence just increases
We're so selfish, cruel and blind
We fight and kill each other
In your name, defending you
Do you love some more than others?
We're so lost and confused Hello God, are you out there?
Can you hear us, are you listenin' any more?
Hello God, if we're still on speakin' terms
Can you help us like before?
Oh, the free will you have given
We have made a mockery of
This is no way to be livin',
We're in great need of your love
Hello God Hello God, can you grant us
Love enough to make amends
(Hello God) Is there still a chance
That we could start again
Hello God, we've learned our lesson
Dear God, don't let us go
More than ever
Hello God, hello, hello
Hello God, we really need you
We can't make it without you
(Hello God) We beseech you
In the name of all that's true
Hello God, please forgive us
For we know not what we do Hello God, give us one more chance to prove ourselves to you
Hello, God; hello, God Nobody believes that I really care for you
They don't think my heart is true
I don't think you agree
You know I'm a lifetime gaurantee So if they ask you what you mean to me
Don't call it love
Heaven's above
We got a better thing, baby Don't call it love
'Cause that ain't enough
Just tell 'em you're my everything
Go on and tell 'em baby Nobody believes we got somethin' they ain't got
They've never seen a fire this hot
They never got that far
We're burning as bright as any star
So if they ask you what your feelings are Don't call it love
Heaven's above
We've got a better thing, baby
Don't call it love
'Cause that ain't enough
Just tell 'em you're my everything
Go ahead and tell 'em baby Feels so good, holding tight
Loving you through the night
Oh and they can call it what they like
But they ain't got it right
No, no, no Don't call it love
Heaven's above
We've got a better thing, baby
Don't call it love
'Cause that ain't enough
Just tell them you're my everything
Oooo... Don't call it love

Don't call it love
'Cause that ain't enough
Just tell 'em you're my everything Oh, oh, oh
Don't call it love
Heaven's above
We got a better thing, baby
Don't call it love
'Cause that ain't enough I am a seeker, a poor sinful creature
There is no weaker than I am
I am a seeker, you are a teacher
You are a reacher, so reach down Won't you reach out and lead me
Guide me and keep me
In the shelter of your care each day
'Cause I am a seeker, you are a keeper
You are the leader, won't you show me the way? I am a vessel that's empty and useless
I am a bad seed that fell by the way
I am a loser that wants to be a winner
And you are my last hope
Don't turn me away I am a seeker, a poor sinful creature
There is no weaker than I am
I am a seeker, you are a teacher
You are a reacher, so reach down Won't you reach out and lead me
Guide me and keep me, Lord
In the shelter of your care each day
'Cause I am a seeker, you are a keeper
You are the leader, won't you show me the way? Oh, I know you are a mountain
From which there flows a fountain
So let it's water wash my sins away
'Cause I am a seeker, you are a keeper
You are the leader, won't you show me the way? Happy, happy birthday baby
Although you're with somebody new
Thought I'd drop a line to say
That I wish this happy day
Would find me beside you
Happy, happy birthday baby
No, I can't call you my baby
Seems like years ago we met
On a day I can't forget
Cause that's when we fell in love Do you remember
The names we had for each other
I was your pretty
You were my baby
Oh, how could we say goodbye Hope I didn't spoil your birthday
I'm not acting like a lady
So I'll close this note to you
With good luck and wishes too
Happy happy birthday baby (Dolly Parton) Well I met a boy from Grassy Branch
Fine as he can be
I met him at the big barn dance
And he took a shine to me
Sky-blue eyes, a big wide smile
And tall as a sycamore tree
He's real smart with a real big heart
And he's gonna marry me
He's gonna marry me
And we're gonna go to town
We're gonna buy some real good car
And we're gonna drive around
We'll hold hands an' touch 'n' hug
He talks so sweet to me
Cause he knows a lot about love and stuff
And he's gonna marry me His momma don't like me one little bit
But you know I don't care
Let her pitch her hissy-fit
Cause I ain't a'marryin' her
He's always been a momma's boy
It's just plain jealousy
She's as mad as an old wet hen
Cause he's gonna marry me Oh, an' he's gonna marry me
An' he's gonna buy me a ring
We're gonna be so free
Cut momma's apron strings
He's gonna build me a pretty little house
Have a pretty little babe of three
Cause he done kiss me on the mouth
An' he's gonna marry me Yeah, he's gonna marry me
He's gonna buy me a ring
We're gonna be so free
Cut momma's apron strings
He's gonna build me a pretty little house
Have a pretty little babe of three
Cause he's done kiss me on the mouth
So he's gotta marry me
Yeah he's done kiss me on the mouth
And he's gonna marry me Yodel-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de The gates and doors were barred
And all the windows fastened down
I spent the night in sleeplessness
And rose at every sound
Half in hope of sorrow
And half in fear the day
Would find the soldiers breakin' through
To drag us all away
And just before the sunrise
I heard something at the wall
The gate began to rattle
And a voice began to call
I hurried to the window
Looked down into the street
Expecting swords and torches
And the sound of soldiers' feet But there was no one there but Mary
So I went down to let her in
John stood there beside me
As she told me where she'd been
She said they've moved Him in the night
And none of us know where
The stone's been rolled away
And now His body isn't there We both ran towards the garden
Then John ran on ahead
We found the stone and empty tomb
Just the way that Mary said
But the winding sheet they wrapped Him in
Was just an empty shell
And how or where they'd taken Him
Was more than I could tell Oh something strange had happened there
Just what I did not know
John believed a miracle
But I just turned to go
Circumstance and speculation
Couldn't lift me very high
'Cause I'd seen them crucify Him
Then I saw Him die Back inside the house again
The guilt and anguish came
Everything I'd promised Him
Just added to my shame
When at last it came to choices
I denied I knew His name
And even if He was alive
It wouldn't be the same But suddenly the air was filled
With a strange and sweet perfume
Light that came from everywhere
Drove shadows from the room
And Jesus stood before me
With His arms held open wide
And I fell down on my knees
And I just clung to Him and cried Then He raised me to my feet
And as I looked into His eyes
The love was shining out from Him
Like sunlight from the skies
Guilt in my confusion
Disappeared in sweet release
And every fear I ever had
Just melted into peace He's alive yes He's alive
Yes He's alive and I'm forgiven
Heaven's gates are open wide
He's alive yes He's alive
Oh He's alive and I'm forgiven
Heaven's gates are open wide
He's alive He's alive
Hallelujah He's alive
He's alive and I'm forgiven
Heaven's gates are open wide
He's alive He's alive He's alive
I believe it He's alive
Sweet Jesus New York City ain't no kind of place
For a country girl with a friendly face
If you smile people look at you funny, they take it wrong
The greenest state in the land of the free
And the home of the Grand Ole Opry
Is calling me back to my Smoky Mountain home I wish I had my old fishin' pole
And was sitting on the banks of the fishing hole
Eating green apples and waiting for the fish to bite
Life ain't as simple as it used to be
Just since the big apple took a bite out of me
And Lord, I'm so Tennessee homesick that I could die But I ain't been home in I don't know when
If I had it all to do over again
Tonight I'd sleep in my old feather bed
What I wouldn't give for a little bitty taste
Of Mama's homemade chocolate cake
Tennessee homesick blues is running through my head Mama you can fluff my feather bed
Just as soon as I can I'm gonna head
Back to the Tennessee hills and it better be soon
Daddy you can load the rifles up
We're gonna load them dogs on the pickup truck
And head up to Calhoun Country and catch us a coon But I ain't been home in I don't know when
If I had it all to do over again
Tonight I'd sleep in my old feather bed
Eatin' grits and gravy and country ham
Go to church on Sunday with dinner on the grounds
Tennessee homesick blues are runnin' through my head And I ain't been home in I don't know when
If I had it all to do over again
Tonight I'd sleep in my old feather bed
Good Lord, have mercy on a country girl
Tryin' to make a living in a rhinestone world
It's hard to be a diamond in a rhinestone world
With Tennessee homesick blues are runnin' through my head
I've got those Tennessee homesick blues runnin' through my head
Tennessee homesick blues I remember the time when the bloom was on the cotton
When our hearts chased the clouds like the swallows on their wings
Winter cares which we're already few or soon forgotten
Just sittin' on the front porch swing Oh we sit every Sunday and watched the married ladies
And we dreamed of white dresses and church bells in the spring
And they talked and painted their nails while they let us hold their babies
Sittin' on the front porch swing Where was I when the time came to join the married ladies
Why did I paint the nail when the finger had no ring
Why do I sit at night at my age to hold their baby
Sittin' on the front porch swing When the mind longs to follow but the memory erases
And the lips form the words that the heart no longer sings
When the leaves in the hollow have been died to match our faces
Sittin' on the front porch swing Oh we'll dream of the time when the bloom was on the cotton
When our hearts chased the clouds like the swallows on their wings
But the words to the rhyme are the only things forgotten
Sittin' on the front porch swing
Sittin' on the front porch swing People always comin' up to me and askin'
"Dolly, what's your secret?
With all you do, your attitude
Just seems to be so good
How do you keep it?"
Well, I'm not the Dalai Lama, but I'll try
To offer up a few words of advice. Chorus:
You better get to livin', givin'
Don't forget to throw in a little forgivin'
And lovin' on the way
You better get to knowin', showin'
A little bit more concerned about where you're goin'
Just a word unto the wise
You better get to livin'. A girlfriend came to my house
Started cryin' on my shoulder Sunday evening
She was spinnin' such a sad tale
I could not believe the yarn that she was weavin'
So negative the words she had to say
I said if I had a violin I'd play. I said you'd better get to livin', givin'
Be willing and forgivin'
Cause all healing has to start with you
You better stop whining, pining
Get your dreams in line
And then just shine, design, refine
Until they come true
And you better get to livin'. Your life's a wreck, your house is mess
And your wardrobe way outdated
All your plans just keep on falling through
Overweight and under paid, under appreciated
I'm no guru, but I'll tell you
This I know is true. You better get to livin', givin'
A little more thought about bein'
A little more willin' to make a better way
Don't sweat the small stuff
Keep your chin up
Just hang tough
And if it gets too rough
Fall on your knees and pray
And do that everyday
Then you'll get to livin'. The day we're born we start to die
Don't waste one minute of this life
Get to livin'
Share your dreams and share your laughter
Make some points for the great hereafter. Better start carin'
Better start sharin'
Better start tryin'
Better start smiling
And you better get to livin'... (Dolly Parton) Say forever you'll be mine
Forever is the love that is filled with understanding
Forever is the love that is true and undemanding
Forever is the love that can stand the test of time
Forever I am yours, say forever you'll be mine Trouble clouds may fill our skies
It might even rain awhile
But the rain will go away
There's always a brighter day Darling, I won't promise you
That we'll be happy all the time
But forever I am yours, say forever you'll be mine
Forever I am yours, say forever you'll be mine
Say forever you'll be mine, forever I am yours
And I'll do anything that you ever ask me to
And I'll do what you want me to Darling, I won't promise you
That we'll be happy all the time
But forever I am yours, say forever you'll be mine (Dolly Parton) Late one cold and stormy night I heard a dog a' barkin'
Then I thought I heard somebody at my door a' knockin'
I wondered who could be outdide in such an awful storm
Then I saw a little girl with a puppy in her arms
Before I could say a word she said, 'My name is Sandy
And this here is my puppy dog, it's name is little Andy'
Standing in the bitter cold in just a ragged dress
Then I asked her to come in and this is what she said Ain't ya got no gingerbread
Ain't ya got no candy
Ain't ya got an extra bed for me and little Andy
Patty cake and bakersman
My mommy ran away again
And we was all alone and didn't know what else to do
I wonder if you'll let us stay with you Giddy up trotty horse, going to the mill
Can we stay all night
If you don't love us no one will
I promise we won't cry
London bridge is fallin' down
My daddy's drunk again in town
And we was all alone and didn't what we could do
I wonder if you'll let us stay with you She was just a little girl, not more than six or seven
But that night as they slept the angels took them both to heaven
God knew little Andy would be lonesome with her gone
Now Sandy and her puppy dog won't ever be alone Ain't ya got no gingerbread
Ain't ya got no candy
Ain't ya got an extra bed for me and little (whispers) Andy (Dolly Parton) Hello, are you free tonight
I like your looks, I love your smile
Could I use you for a while,
It's all wrong, but it's all right The amber sunset glow has died
My needs are very much alive
Is it ok if I stop by
It's all wrong, but it's all right It's all wrong, but it's all right
Just close your eyes and hold me tight
Tell me sexy lovin' lines
It's all wrong, but it's all right It may be wrong if we make love
But I just need someone so much
And who knows it might last for life
It's all wrong, but it's all right It's all wrong, but it's all right
Just close your eyes and hold me tight
Tell me sexy lovin' lines
It's all wrong, but it's all right It's all wrong, but it's all right
Just close your eyes and fantasize
Tell me sexy lovin' lines
It's all wrong, but it's all right It's all wrong, but it's all right

Tell me sexy lovin' lines

As I was travelin', travelin', travelin', travelin', travelin' thru I'm just travelin', travelin', travelin', I'm just travelin'
Drifting like a floating boat and roaming like the wind
Oh give me some direction lord, let me lean on you
As I'm travelin', travelin', travelin', thru I'm just travelin', travelin', travelin', I'm just travelin' thru
I'm just travelin', travelin', travelin', I'm just travelin' thru Like the poor wayfaring stranger that they speak about in song
I'm just a weary pilgrim trying to find my own way home
Oh sweet Jesus if you're out there, keep me ever close to you
As I'm travelin', travelin', travelin', as I'm travelin' thru Momma moved out
Daddy sold the house
They split up the money
And went on their way
And all the king's horses
And all the king's men
Couldn't put mommy and daddy back together again Starting over again
Where should they begin
Cause they've never been out on their own
Starting over again
Where do you begin
When your dreams are all shattered
And the kids are all grown
And the whole world cries Got an apartment
She moved in with her sisters
He's scheming big deals with one of his friends
While she sits at home
Just sorting out pieces
Of left over memories
From thirty odd years Starting over again
Where do you begin
You've never been out on your own
Starting over again
Never any end What will the neighbors say?
They're talking talk, it's small town news
Facing fifty years old
Making up a happy home
And this far down the road
You find yourself alone
Two fools Starting over again
Now where do you begin
When you've never been out on your own
Starting over again
Never any end
When your dreams are all shattered
And the kids are all grown
And all the king's horses
And all the king's men
Could never put mommy and daddy back together
Back together, again (Dolly Parton) Chorus:
Love is pretty when love is new
Like a blushing rose in a dazzling dew,
Intoxicating like cherry sweet wine.
When love is new it's magic. Verse 1: Mother, oh Mother, why can't you see
He's the only love for me.
Why must thou be opposed to me
I'm asking for thy blessing. Daughter, oh daughter, I know his kind.
You think he's handsome, you think he's fine.
He'll use your body and tangle your mind;
Too late you'll learn this lesson Repeat Chorus When love grows cold, it's tragic Verse 2: Mother, oh mother, he's not that way
His touch just takes my breath away.
You surely remember when you felt that way
When you and father first married Oh, yes, I do remember it well.
What first was heaven soon turned to hell
He left with another the year you were born.
I told you he's dead and buried. Repeat Chorus Bridge: He'll love me true 'cause he told me so.
He'll break you heart when love grows old.
I must go, Mother, I must go.
Then, daughter, why are you asking?
I love him so, I love him so.
Then I pray you're new love's lasting. Repeat Chorus Tag: When love grows cold, it's tragic. 
My dog called 40 before he turned 20
Money is earned, the rest is inherited
Hashish come from Marrakech, all my kush is American
Man I feel like a therapist, pistol on me like Maravich
I careless, I'm so perilous with all of this arrogance, goddamn
Money, hoes, that's something that you can't chase
I ain't shit but let you eat from the same plate
If you ungrateful then you ain't great
Me and Khaled come from the same place
Huh, holy land, holy land
Back when I was holdin' grams just to haul a Benz
Yeah, holy land, holy land
My father never was a holy man 
I'll be there
Always

SUCCESS.

[Published in "A Masque of Poets"
at the request of "H.H.," the author's
fellow-townswoman and friend.]

Success is counted sweetest
By those who ne'er succeed.
To comprehend a nectar
Requires sorest need.

Not one of all the purple host
Who took the flag to-day
Can tell the definition,
So clear, of victory,

As he, defeated, dying,
On whose forbidden ear
The distant strains of triumph
Break, agonized and clear!





II.

Our share of night to bear,
Our share of morning,
Our blank in bliss to fill,
Our blank in scorning.

Here a star, and there a star,
Some lose their way.
Here a mist, and there a mist,
Afterwards — day!





III.

ROUGE ET NOIR.

Soul, wilt thou toss again?
By just such a hazard
Hundreds have lost, indeed,
But tens have won an all.

Angels' breathless ballot
Lingers to record thee;
Imps in eager caucus
Raffle for my soul.





IV.

ROUGE GAGNE.

'T is so much joy! 'T is so much joy!
If I should fail, what poverty!
And yet, as poor as I
Have ventured all upon a throw;
Have gained! Yes! Hesitated so
This side the victory!

Life is but life, and death but death!
Bliss is but bliss, and breath but breath!
And if, indeed, I fail,
At least to know the worst is sweet.
Defeat means nothing but defeat,
No drearier can prevail!

And if I gain, — oh, gun at sea,
Oh, bells that in the steeples be,
At first repeat it slow!
For heaven is a different thing
Conjectured, and waked sudden in,
And might o'erwhelm me so!





V.

Glee! The great storm is over!
Four have recovered the land;
Forty gone down together
Into the boiling sand.

Ring, for the scant salvation!
Toll, for the bonnie souls, —
Neighbor and friend and bridegroom,
Spinning upon the shoals!

How they will tell the shipwreck
When winter shakes the door,
Till the children ask, "But the forty?
Did they come back no more?"

Then a silence suffuses the story,
And a softness the teller's eye;
And the children no further question,
And only the waves reply.





VI.

If I can stop one heart from breaking,
I shall not live in vain;
If I can ease one life the aching,
Or cool one pain,
Or help one fainting robin
Unto his nest again,
I shall not live in vain.





VII.

ALMOST!

Within my reach!
I could have touched!
I might have chanced that way!
Soft sauntered through the village,
Sauntered as soft away!
So unsuspected violets
Within the fields lie low,
Too late for striving fingers
That passed, an hour ago.





VIII.

A wounded deer leaps highest,
I've heard the hunter tell;
'T is but the ecstasy of death,
And then the brake is still.

The smitten rock that gushes,
The trampled steel that springs;
A cheek is always redder
Just where the hectic stings!

Mirth is the mail of anguish,
In which it cautions arm,
Lest anybody spy the blood
And "You're hurt" exclaim!





IX.

The heart asks pleasure first,
And then, excuse from pain;
And then, those little anodynes
That deaden suffering;

And then, to go to sleep;
And then, if it should be
The will of its Inquisitor,
The liberty to die.





X.

IN A LIBRARY.

A precious, mouldering pleasure 't is
To meet an antique book,
In just the dress his century wore;
A privilege, I think,

His venerable hand to take,
And warming in our own,
A passage back, or two, to make
To times when he was young.

His quaint opinions to inspect,
His knowledge to unfold
On what concerns our mutual mind,
The literature of old;

What interested scholars most,
What competitions ran
When Plato was a certainty.
And Sophocles a man;

When Sappho was a living girl,
And Beatrice wore
The gown that Dante deified.
Facts, centuries before,

He traverses familiar,
As one should come to town
And tell you all your dreams were true;
He lived where dreams were sown.

His presence is enchantment,
You beg him not to go;
Old volumes shake their vellum heads
And tantalize, just so.





XI.

Much madness is divinest sense
To a discerning eye;
Much sense the starkest madness.
'T is the majority
In this, as all, prevails.
Assent, and you are sane;
Demur, — you're straightway dangerous,
And handled with a chain.





XII.

I asked no other thing,
No other was denied.
I offered Being for it;
The mighty merchant smiled.

Brazil? He twirled a button,
Without a glance my way:
"But, madam, is there nothing else
That we can show to-day?"





XIII.

EXCLUSION.

The soul selects her own society,
Then shuts the door;
On her divine majority
Obtrude no more.

Unmoved, she notes the chariot's pausing
At her low gate;
Unmoved, an emperor is kneeling
Upon her mat.

I've known her from an ample nation
Choose one;
Then close the valves of her attention
Like stone.





XIV.

THE SECRET.

Some things that fly there be, —
Birds, hours, the bumble-bee:
Of these no elegy.

Some things that stay there be, —
Grief, hills, eternity:
Nor this behooveth me.

There are, that resting, rise.
Can I expound the skies?
How still the riddle lies!





XV.

THE LONELY HOUSE.

I know some lonely houses off the road
A robber 'd like the look of, —
Wooden barred,
And windows hanging low,
Inviting to
A portico,
Where two could creep:
One hand the tools,
The other peep
To make sure all's asleep.
Old-fashioned eyes,
Not easy to surprise!

How orderly the kitchen 'd look by night,
With just a clock, —
But they could gag the tick,
And mice won't bark;
And so the walls don't tell,
None will.

A pair of spectacles ajar just stir —
An almanac's aware.
Was it the mat winked,
Or a nervous star?
The moon slides down the stair
To see who's there.

There's plunder, — where?
Tankard, or spoon,
Earring, or stone,
A watch, some ancient brooch
To match the grandmamma,
Staid sleeping there.

Day rattles, too,
Stealth's slow;
The sun has got as far
As the third sycamore.
Screams chanticleer,
"Who's there?"
And echoes, trains away,
Sneer — "Where?"
While the old couple, just astir,
Fancy the sunrise left the door ajar!





XVI.

To fight aloud is very brave,
But gallanter, I know,
Who charge within the bosom,
The cavalry of woe.

Who win, and nations do not see,
Who fall, and none observe,
Whose dying eyes no country
Regards with patriot love.

We trust, in plumed procession,
For such the angels go,
Rank after rank, with even feet
And uniforms of snow.





XVII.

DAWN.

When night is almost done,
And sunrise grows so near
That we can touch the spaces,
It 's time to smooth the hair

And get the dimples ready,
And wonder we could care
For that old faded midnight
That frightened but an hour.





XVIII.

THE BOOK OF MARTYRS.

Read, sweet, how others strove,
Till we are stouter;
What they renounced,
Till we are less afraid;
How many times they bore
The faithful witness,
Till we are helped,
As if a kingdom cared!

Read then of faith
That shone above the fagot;
Clear strains of hymn
The river could not drown;
Brave names of men
And celestial women,
Passed out of record
Into renown!





XIX.

THE MYSTERY OF PAIN.

Pain has an element of blank;
It cannot recollect
When it began, or if there were
A day when it was not.

It has no future but itself,
Its infinite realms contain
Its past, enlightened to perceive
New periods of pain.





XX.

I taste a liquor never brewed,
From tankards scooped in pearl;
Not all the vats upon the Rhine
Yield such an alcohol!

Inebriate of air am I,
And debauchee of dew,
Reeling, through endless summer days,
From inns of molten blue.

When landlords turn the drunken bee
Out of the foxglove's door,
When butterflies renounce their drams,
I shall but drink the more!

Till seraphs swing their snowy hats,
And saints to windows run,
To see the little tippler
Leaning against the sun!





XXI.

A BOOK.

He ate and drank the precious words,
His spirit grew robust;
He knew no more that he was poor,
Nor that his frame was dust.
He danced along the dingy days,
And this bequest of wings
Was but a book. What liberty
A loosened spirit brings!





XXII.

I had no time to hate, because
The grave would hinder me,
And life was not so ample I
Could finish enmity.

Nor had I time to love; but since
Some industry must be,
The little toil of love, I thought,
Was large enough for me.





XXIII.

UNRETURNING.

'T was such a little, little boat
That toddled down the bay!
'T was such a gallant, gallant sea
That beckoned it away!

'T was such a greedy, greedy wave
That licked it from the coast;
Nor ever guessed the stately sails
My little craft was lost!





XXIV.

Whether my bark went down at sea,
Whether she met with gales,
Whether to isles enchanted
She bent her docile sails;

By what mystic mooring
She is held to-day, —
This is the errand of the eye
Out upon the bay.





XXV.

Belshazzar had a letter, —
He never had but one;
Belshazzar's correspondent
Concluded and begun
In that immortal copy
The conscience of us all
Can read without its glasses
On revelation's wall.





XXVI.

The brain within its groove
Runs evenly and true;
But let a splinter swerve,
'T were easier for you
To put the water back
When floods have slit the hills,
And scooped a turnpike for themselves,
And blotted out the mills!





II. LOVE.





I.

MINE.

Mine by the right of the white election!
Mine by the royal seal!
Mine by the sign in the scarlet prison
Bars cannot conceal!

Mine, here in vision and in veto!
Mine, by the grave's repeal
Titled, confirmed, — delirious charter!
Mine, while the ages steal!





II.

BEQUEST.

You left me, sweet, two legacies, —
A legacy of love
A Heavenly Father would content,
Had He the offer of;

You left me boundaries of pain
Capacious as the sea,
Between eternity and time,
Your consciousness and me.





III.

Alter? When the hills do.
Falter? When the sun
Question if his glory
Be the perfect one.

Surfeit? When the daffodil
Doth of the dew:
Even as herself, O friend!
I will of you!





IV.

SUSPENSE.

Elysium is as far as to
The very nearest room,
If in that room a friend await
Felicity or doom.

What fortitude the soul contains,
That it can so endure
The accent of a coming foot,
The opening of a door!





V.

SURRENDER.

Doubt me, my dim companion!
Why, God would be content
With but a fraction of the love
Poured thee without a stint.
The whole of me, forever,
What more the woman can, —
Say quick, that I may dower thee
With last delight I own!

It cannot be my spirit,
For that was thine before;
I ceded all of dust I knew, —
What opulence the more
Had I, a humble maiden,
Whose farthest of degree
Was that she might,
Some distant heaven,
Dwell timidly with thee!





VI.

If you were coming in the fall,
I'd brush the summer by
With half a smile and half a spurn,
As housewives do a fly.

If I could see you in a year,
I'd wind the months in balls,
And put them each in separate drawers,
Until their time befalls.

If only centuries delayed,
I'd count them on my hand,
Subtracting till my fingers dropped
Into Van Diemen's land.

If certain, when this life was out,
That yours and mine should be,
I'd toss it yonder like a rind,
And taste eternity.

But now, all ignorant of the length
Of time's uncertain wing,
It goads me, like the goblin bee,
That will not state its sting.





VII.

WITH A FLOWER.

I hide myself within my flower,
That wearing on your breast,
You, unsuspecting, wear me too —
And angels know the rest.

I hide myself within my flower,
That, fading from your vase,
You, unsuspecting, feel for me
Almost a loneliness.





VIII.

PROOF.

That I did always love,
I bring thee proof:
That till I loved
I did not love enough.

That I shall love alway,
I offer thee
That love is life,
And life hath immortality.

This, dost thou doubt, sweet?
Then have I
Nothing to show
But Calvary.





IX.

Have you got a brook in your little heart,
Where bashful flowers blow,
And blushing birds go down to drink,
And shadows tremble so?

And nobody knows, so still it flows,
That any brook is there;
And yet your little draught of life
Is daily drunken there.

Then look out for the little brook in March,
When the rivers overflow,
And the snows come hurrying from the hills,
And the bridges often go.

And later, in August it may be,
When the meadows parching lie,
Beware, lest this little brook of life
Some burning noon go dry!





X.

TRANSPLANTED.

As if some little Arctic flower,
Upon the polar hem,
Went wandering down the latitudes,
Until it puzzled came
To continents of summer,
To firmaments of sun,
To strange, bright crowds of flowers,
And birds of foreign tongue!
I say, as if this little flower
To Eden wandered in —
What then? Why, nothing, only,
Your inference therefrom!





XI.

THE OUTLET.

My river runs to thee:
Blue sea, wilt welcome me?

My river waits reply.
Oh sea, look graciously!

I'll fetch thee brooks
From spotted nooks, —

Say, sea,
Take me!





XII.

IN VAIN.

I cannot live with you,
It would be life,
And life is over there
Behind the shelf

The sexton keeps the key to,
Putting up
Our life, his porcelain,
Like a cup

Discarded of the housewife,
Quaint or broken;
A newer Sevres pleases,
Old ones crack.

I could not die with you,
For one must wait
To shut the other's gaze down, —
You could not.

And I, could I stand by
And see you freeze,
Without my right of frost,
Death's privilege?

Nor could I rise with you,
Because your face
Would put out Jesus',
That new grace

Glow plain and foreign
On my homesick eye,
Except that you, than he
Shone closer by.

They'd judge us — how?
For you served Heaven, you know,
Or sought to;
I could not,

Because you saturated sight,
And I had no more eyes
For sordid excellence
As Paradise.

And were you lost, I would be,
Though my name
Rang loudest
On the heavenly fame.

And were you saved,
And I condemned to be
Where you were not,
That self were hell to me.

So we must keep apart,
You there, I here,
With just the door ajar
That oceans are,
And prayer,
And that pale sustenance,
Despair!





XIII.

RENUNCIATION.

First page of Renunciation Second page of Renunciation Third page of Renunciation Fourth page of Renunciation


There came a day at summer's full
Entirely for me;
I thought that such were for the saints,
Where revelations be.

The sun, as common, went abroad,
The flowers, accustomed, blew,
As if no soul the solstice passed
That maketh all things new.

The time was scarce profaned by speech;
The symbol of a word
Was needless, as at sacrament
The wardrobe of our Lord.

Each was to each the sealed church,
Permitted to commune this time,
Lest we too awkward show
At supper of the Lamb.

The hours slid fast, as hours will,
Clutched tight by greedy hands;
So faces on two decks look back,
Bound to opposing lands.

And so, when all the time had failed,
Without external sound,
Each bound the other's crucifix,
We gave no other bond.

Sufficient troth that we shall rise —
Deposed, at length, the grave —
To that new marriage, justified
Through Calvaries of Love!





XIV.

LOVE'S BAPTISM.

I'm ceded, I've stopped being theirs;
The name they dropped upon my face
With water, in the country church,
Is finished using now,
And they can put it with my dolls,
My childhood, and the string of spools
I've finished threading too.

Baptized before without the choice,
But this time consciously, of grace
Unto supremest name,
Called to my full, the crescent dropped,
Existence's whole arc filled up
With one small diadem.

My second rank, too small the first,
Crowned, crowing on my father's breast,
A half unconscious queen;
But this time, adequate, erect,
With will to choose or to reject.
And I choose — just a throne.





XV.

RESURRECTION.

'T was a long parting, but the time
For interview had come;
Before the judgment-seat of God,
The last and second time

These fleshless lovers met,
A heaven in a gaze,
A heaven of heavens, the privilege
Of one another's eyes.

No lifetime set on them,
Apparelled as the new
Unborn, except they had beheld,
Born everlasting now.

Was bridal e'er like this?
A paradise, the host,
And cherubim and seraphim
The most familiar guest.





XVI.

APOCALYPSE.

I'm wife; I've finished that,
That other state;
I'm Czar, I'm woman now:
It's safer so.

How odd the girl's life looks
Behind this soft eclipse!
I think that earth seems so
To those in heaven now.

This being comfort, then
That other kind was pain;
But why compare?
I'm wife! stop there!





XVII.

THE WIFE.

She rose to his requirement, dropped
The playthings of her life
To take the honorable work
Of woman and of wife.

If aught she missed in her new day
Of amplitude, or awe,
Or first prospective, or the gold
In using wore away,

It lay unmentioned, as the sea
Develops pearl and weed,
But only to himself is known
The fathoms they abide.





XVIII.

APOTHEOSIS.

Come slowly, Eden!
Lips unused to thee,
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,

Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars — enters,
And is lost in balms!





III. NATURE.





I.

New feet within my garden go,
New fingers stir the sod;
A troubadour upon the elm
Betrays the solitude.

New children play upon the green,
New weary sleep below;
And still the pensive spring returns,
And still the punctual snow!





II.

MAY-FLOWER.

Pink, small, and punctual,
Aromatic, low,
Covert in April,
Candid in May,

Dear to the moss,
Known by the knoll,
Next to the robin
In every human soul.

Bold little beauty,
Bedecked with thee,
Nature forswears
Antiquity.





III.

WHY?

The murmur of a bee
A witchcraft yieldeth me.
If any ask me why,
'T were easier to die
Than tell.

The red upon the hill
Taketh away my will;
If anybody sneer,
Take care, for God is here,
That's all.

The breaking of the day
Addeth to my degree;
If any ask me how,
Artist, who drew me so,
Must tell!





IV.

Perhaps you'd like to buy a flower?
But I could never sell.
If you would like to borrow
Until the daffodil

Unties her yellow bonnet
Beneath the village door,
Until the bees, from clover rows
Their hock and sherry draw,

Why, I will lend until just then,
But not an hour more!





V.

The pedigree of honey
Does not concern the bee;
A clover, any time, to him
Is aristocracy.





VI.

A SERVICE OF SONG.

Some keep the Sabbath going to church;
I keep it staying at home,
With a bobolink for a chorister,
And an orchard for a dome.

Some keep the Sabbath in surplice;
I just wear my wings,
And instead of tolling the bell for church,
Our little sexton sings.

God preaches, — a noted clergyman, —
And the sermon is never long;
So instead of getting to heaven at last,
I'm going all along!





VII.

The bee is not afraid of me,
I know the butterfly;
The pretty people in the woods
Receive me cordially.

The brooks laugh louder when I come,
The breezes madder play.
Wherefore, mine eyes, thy silver mists?
Wherefore, O summer's day?





VIII.

SUMMER'S ARMIES.

Some rainbow coming from the fair!
Some vision of the world Cashmere
I confidently see!
Or else a peacock's purple train,
Feather by feather, on the plain
Fritters itself away!

The dreamy butterflies bestir,
Lethargic pools resume the whir
Of last year's sundered tune.
From some old fortress on the sun
Baronial bees march, one by one,
In murmuring platoon!

The robins stand as thick to-day
As flakes of snow stood yesterday,
On fence and roof and twig.
The orchis binds her feather on
For her old lover, Don the Sun,
Revisiting the bog!

Without commander, countless, still,
The regiment of wood and hill
In bright detachment stand.
Behold! Whose multitudes are these?
The children of whose turbaned seas,
Or what Circassian land?





IX.

THE GRASS.

The grass so little has to do, —
A sphere of simple green,
With only butterflies to brood,
And bees to entertain,

And stir all day to pretty tunes
The breezes fetch along,
And hold the sunshine in its lap
And bow to everything;

And thread the dews all night, like pearls,
And make itself so fine, —
A duchess were too common
For such a noticing.

And even when it dies, to pass
In odors so divine,
As lowly spices gone to sleep,
Or amulets of pine.

And then to dwell in sovereign barns,
And dream the days away, —
The grass so little has to do,
I wish I were the hay!





X.

A little road not made of man,
Enabled of the eye,
Accessible to thill of bee,
Or cart of butterfly.

If town it have, beyond itself,
'T is that I cannot say;
I only sigh, — no vehicle
Bears me along that way.





XI.

SUMMER SHOWER.

A drop fell on the apple tree,
Another on the roof;
A half a dozen kissed the eaves,
And made the gables laugh.

A few went out to help the brook,
That went to help the sea.
Myself conjectured, Were they pearls,
What necklaces could be!

The dust replaced in hoisted roads,
The birds jocoser sung;
The sunshine threw his hat away,
The orchards spangles hung.

The breezes brought dejected lutes,
And bathed them in the glee;
The East put out a single flag,
And signed the fete away.





XII.

PSALM OF THE DAY.

A something in a summer's day,
As slow her flambeaux burn away,
Which solemnizes me.

A something in a summer's noon, —
An azure depth, a wordless tune,
Transcending ecstasy.

And still within a summer's night
A something so transporting bright,
I clap my hands to see;

Then veil my too inspecting face,
Lest such a subtle, shimmering grace
Flutter too far for me.

The wizard-fingers never rest,
The purple brook within the breast
Still chafes its narrow bed;

Still rears the East her amber flag,
Guides still the sun along the crag
His caravan of red,

Like flowers that heard the tale of dews,
But never deemed the dripping prize
Awaited their low brows;

Or bees, that thought the summer's name
Some rumor of delirium
No summer could for them;

Or Arctic creature, dimly stirred
By tropic hint, — some travelled bird
Imported to the wood;

Or wind's bright signal to the ear,
Making that homely and severe,
Contented, known, before

The heaven unexpected came,
To lives that thought their worshipping
A too presumptuous psalm.





XIII.

THE SEA OF SUNSET.

This is the land the sunset washes,
These are the banks of the Yellow Sea;
Where it rose, or whither it rushes,
These are the western mystery!

Night after night her purple traffic
Strews the landing with opal bales;
Merchantmen poise upon horizons,
Dip, and vanish with fairy sails.





XIV.

PURPLE CLOVER.

There is a flower that bees prefer,
And butterflies desire;
To gain the purple democrat
The humming-birds aspire.

And whatsoever insect pass,
A honey bears away
Proportioned to his several dearth
And her capacity.

Her face is rounder than the moon,
And ruddier than the gown
Of orchis in the pasture,
Or rhododendron worn.

She doth not wait for June;
Before the world is green
Her sturdy little countenance
Against the wind is seen,

Contending with the grass,
Near kinsman to herself,
For privilege of sod and sun,
Sweet litigants for life.

And when the hills are full,
And newer fashions blow,
Doth not retract a single spice
For pang of jealousy.

Her public is the noon,
Her providence the sun,
Her progress by the bee proclaimed
In sovereign, swerveless tune.

The bravest of the host,
Surrendering the last,
Nor even of defeat aware
When cancelled by the frost.





XV.

THE BEE.

Like trains of cars on tracks of plush
I hear the level bee:
A jar across the flowers goes,
Their velvet masonry

Withstands until the sweet assault
Their chivalry consumes,
While he, victorious, tilts away
To vanquish other blooms.

His feet are shod with gauze,
His helmet is of gold;
His breast, a single onyx
With chrysoprase, inlaid.

His labor is a chant,
His idleness a tune;
Oh, for a bee's experience
Of clovers and of noon!





XVI.

Presentiment is that long shadow on the lawn
Indicative that suns go down;
The notice to the startled grass
That darkness is about to pass.





XVII.

As children bid the guest good-night,
And then reluctant turn,
My flowers raise their pretty lips,
Then put their nightgowns on.

As children caper when they wake,
Merry that it is morn,
My flowers from a hundred cribs
Will peep, and prance again.





XVIII.

Angels in the early morning
May be seen the dews among,
Stooping, plucking, smiling, flying:
Do the buds to them belong?

Angels when the sun is hottest
May be seen the sands among,
Stooping, plucking, sighing, flying;
Parched the flowers they bear along.





XIX.

So bashful when I spied her,
So pretty, so ashamed!
So hidden in her leaflets,
Lest anybody find;

So breathless till I passed her,
So helpless when I turned
And bore her, struggling, blushing,
Her simple haunts beyond!

For whom I robbed the dingle,
For whom betrayed the dell,
Many will doubtless ask me,
But I shall never tell!





XX.

TWO WORLDS.

It makes no difference abroad,
The seasons fit the same,
The mornings blossom into noons,
And split their pods of flame.

Wild-flowers kindle in the woods,
The brooks brag all the day;
No blackbird bates his jargoning
For passing Calvary.

Auto-da-fe and judgment
Are nothing to the bee;
His separation from his rose
To him seems misery.





XXI.

THE MOUNTAIN.

The mountain sat upon the plain
In his eternal chair,
His observation omnifold,
His inquest everywhere.

The seasons prayed around his knees,
Like children round a sire:
Grandfather of the days is he,
Of dawn the ancestor.





XXII.

A DAY.

I'll tell you how the sun rose, —
A ribbon at a time.
The steeples swam in amethyst,
The news like squirrels ran.

The hills untied their bonnets,
The bobolinks begun.
Then I said softly to myself,
"That must have been the sun!"

* * *

But how he set, I know not.
There seemed a purple stile
Which little yellow boys and girls
Were climbing all the while

Till when they reached the other side,
A dominie in gray
Put gently up the evening bars,
And led the flock away.





XXIII.

The butterfly's assumption-gown,
In chrysoprase apartments hung,
   This afternoon put on.

How condescending to descend,
And be of buttercups the friend
   In a New England town!





XXIV.

THE WIND.

Of all the sounds despatched abroad,
There's not a charge to me
Like that old measure in the boughs,
That phraseless melody

The wind does, working like a hand
Whose fingers brush the sky,
Then quiver down, with tufts of tune
Permitted gods and me.

When winds go round and round in bands,
And thrum upon the door,
And birds take places overhead,
To bear them orchestra,

I crave him grace, of summer boughs,
If such an outcast be,
He never heard that fleshless chant
Rise solemn in the tree,

As if some caravan of sound
On deserts, in the sky,
Had broken rank,
Then knit, and passed
In seamless company.





XXV.

DEATH AND LIFE.

Apparently with no surprise
To any happy flower,
The frost beheads it at its play
In accidental power.
The blond assassin passes on,
The sun proceeds unmoved
To measure off another day
For an approving God.





XXVI.

'T was later when the summer went
Than when the cricket came,
And yet we knew that gentle clock
Meant nought but going home.

'T was sooner when the cricket went
Than when the winter came,
Yet that pathetic pendulum
Keeps esoteric time.





XXVII.

INDIAN SUMMER.

These are the days when birds come back,
A very few, a bird or two,
To take a backward look.

These are the days when skies put on
The old, old sophistries of June, —
A blue and gold mistake.

Oh, fraud that cannot cheat the bee,
Almost thy plausibility
Induces my belief,

Till ranks of seeds their witness bear,
And softly through the altered air
Hurries a timid leaf!

Oh, sacrament of summer days,
Oh, last communion in the haze,
Permit a child to join,

Thy sacred emblems to partake,
Thy consecrated bread to break,
Taste thine immortal wine!





XXVIII.

AUTUMN.

The morns are meeker than they were,
The nuts are getting brown;
The berry's cheek is plumper,
The rose is out of town.

The maple wears a gayer scarf,
The field a scarlet gown.
Lest I should be old-fashioned,
I'll put a trinket on.





XXIX.

BECLOUDED.

The sky is low, the clouds are mean,
A travelling flake of snow
Across a barn or through a rut
Debates if it will go.

A narrow wind complains all day
How some one treated him;
Nature, like us, is sometimes caught
Without her diadem.





XXX.

THE HEMLOCK.

I think the hemlock likes to stand
Upon a marge of snow;
It suits his own austerity,
And satisfies an awe

That men must slake in wilderness,
Or in the desert cloy, —
An instinct for the hoar, the bald,
Lapland's necessity.

The hemlock's nature thrives on cold;
The gnash of northern winds
Is sweetest nutriment to him,
His best Norwegian wines.

To satin races he is nought;
But children on the Don
Beneath his tabernacles play,
And Dnieper wrestlers run.





XXXI.

There's a certain slant of light,
On winter afternoons,
That oppresses, like the weight
Of cathedral tunes.

Heavenly hurt it gives us;
We can find no scar,
But internal difference
Where the meanings are.

None may teach it anything,
' T is the seal, despair, —
An imperial affliction
Sent us of the air.

When it comes, the landscape listens,
Shadows hold their breath;
When it goes, 't is like the distance
On the look of death.






IV. TIME AND ETERNITY.




I.

One dignity delays for all,
One mitred afternoon.
None can avoid this purple,
None evade this crown.

Coach it insures, and footmen,
Chamber and state and throng;
Bells, also, in the village,
As we ride grand along.

What dignified attendants,
What service when we pause!
How loyally at parting
Their hundred hats they raise!

How pomp surpassing ermine,
When simple you and I
Present our meek escutcheon,
And claim the rank to die!





II.

TOO LATE.

Delayed till she had ceased to know,
Delayed till in its vest of snow
    Her loving bosom lay.
An hour behind the fleeting breath,
Later by just an hour than death, —
    Oh, lagging yesterday!

Could she have guessed that it would be;
Could but a crier of the glee
    Have climbed the distant hill;
Had not the bliss so slow a pace, —
Who knows but this surrendered face
    Were undefeated still?

Oh, if there may departing be
Any forgot by victory
    In her imperial round,
Show them this meek apparelled thing,
That could not stop to be a king,
    Doubtful if it be crowned!





III.

ASTRA CASTRA.

Departed to the judgment,
A mighty afternoon;
Great clouds like ushers leaning,
Creation looking on.

The flesh surrendered, cancelled,
The bodiless begun;
Two worlds, like audiences, disperse
And leave the soul alone.





IV.

Safe in their alabaster chambers,
Untouched by morning and untouched by noon,
Sleep the meek members of the resurrection,
Rafter of satin, and roof of stone.

Light laughs the breeze in her castle of sunshine;
Babbles the bee in a stolid ear;
Pipe the sweet birds in ignorant cadence, —
Ah, what sagacity perished here!

Grand go the years in the crescent above them;
Worlds scoop their arcs, and firmaments row,
Diadems drop and Doges surrender,
Soundless as dots on a disk of snow.





V.

On this long storm the rainbow rose,
On this late morn the sun;
The clouds, like listless elephants,
Horizons straggled down.

The birds rose smiling in their nests,
The gales indeed were done;
Alas! how heedless were the eyes
On whom the summer shone!

The quiet nonchalance of death
No daybreak can bestir;
The slow archangel's syllables
Must awaken her.





VI.

FROM THE CHRYSALIS.

My cocoon tightens, colors tease,
I'm feeling for the air;
A dim capacity for wings
Degrades the dress I wear.

A power of butterfly must be
The aptitude to fly,
Meadows of majesty concedes
And easy sweeps of sky.

So I must baffle at the hint
And cipher at the sign,
And make much blunder, if at last
I take the clew divine.





VII.

SETTING SAIL.

Exultation is the going
Of an inland soul to sea, —
Past the houses, past the headlands,
Into deep eternity!

Bred as we, among the mountains,
Can the sailor understand
The divine intoxication
Of the first league out from land?





VIII.

Look back on time with kindly eyes,
He doubtless did his best;
How softly sinks his trembling sun
In human nature's west!





IX.

A train went through a burial gate,
A bird broke forth and sang,
And trilled, and quivered, and shook his throat
Till all the churchyard rang;

And then adjusted his little notes,
And bowed and sang again.
Doubtless, he thought it meet of him
To say good-by to men.





X.

I died for beauty, but was scarce
Adjusted in the tomb,
When one who died for truth was lain
In an adjoining room.

He questioned softly why I failed?
"For beauty," I replied.
"And I for truth, — the two are one;
We brethren are," he said.

And so, as kinsmen met a night,
We talked between the rooms,
Until the moss had reached our lips,
And covered up our names.





XI.

"TROUBLED ABOUT MANY THINGS."

How many times these low feet staggered,
Only the soldered mouth can tell;
Try! can you stir the awful rivet?
Try! can you lift the hasps of steel?

Stroke the cool forehead, hot so often,
Lift, if you can, the listless hair;
Handle the adamantine fingers
Never a thimble more shall wear.

Buzz the dull flies on the chamber window;
Brave shines the sun through the freckled pane;
Fearless the cobweb swings from the ceiling —
Indolent housewife, in daisies lain!





XII.

REAL.

I like a look of agony,
Because I know it 's true;
Men do not sham convulsion,
Nor simulate a throe.

The eyes glaze once, and that is death.
Impossible to feign
The beads upon the forehead
By homely anguish strung.





XIII.

THE FUNERAL.

That short, potential stir
That each can make but once,
That bustle so illustrious
'T is almost consequence,

Is the eclat of death.
Oh, thou unknown renown
That not a beggar would accept,
Had he the power to spurn!





XIV.

I went to thank her,
But she slept;
Her bed a funnelled stone,
With nosegays at the head and foot,
That travellers had thrown,

Who went to thank her;
But she slept.
'T was short to cross the sea
To look upon her like, alive,
But turning back 't was slow.





XV.

I've seen a dying eye
Run round and round a room
In search of something, as it seemed,
Then cloudier become;
And then, obscure with fog,
And then be soldered down,
Without disclosing what it be,
'T were blessed to have seen.





XVI.

REFUGE.

The clouds their backs together laid,
The north begun to push,
The forests galloped till they fell,
The lightning skipped like mice;
The thunder crumbled like a stuff —
How good to be safe in tombs,
Where nature's temper cannot reach,
Nor vengeance ever comes!





XVII.

I never saw a moor,
I never saw the sea;
Yet know I how the heather looks,
And what a wave must be.

I never spoke with God,
Nor visited in heaven;
Yet certain am I of the spot
As if the chart were given.





XVIII.

PLAYMATES.

God permits industrious angels
Afternoons to play.
I met one, — forgot my school-mates,
All, for him, straightway.

God calls home the angels promptly
At the setting sun;
I missed mine. How dreary marbles,
After playing Crown!





XIX.

To know just how he suffered would be dear;
To know if any human eyes were near
To whom he could intrust his wavering gaze,
Until it settled firm on Paradise.

To know if he was patient, part content,
Was dying as he thought, or different;
Was it a pleasant day to die,
And did the sunshine face his way?

What was his furthest mind, of home, or God,
Or what the distant say
At news that he ceased human nature
On such a day?

And wishes, had he any?
Just his sigh, accented,
Had been legible to me.
And was he confident until
Ill fluttered out in everlasting well?

And if he spoke, what name was best,
What first,
What one broke off with
At the drowsiest?

Was he afraid, or tranquil?
Might he know
How conscious consciousness could grow,
Till love that was, and love too blest to be,
Meet — and the junction be Eternity?





XX.

The last night that she lived,
It was a common night,
Except the dying; this to us
Made nature different.

We noticed smallest things, —
Things overlooked before,
By this great light upon our minds
Italicized, as 't were.

That others could exist
While she must finish quite,
A jealousy for her arose
So nearly infinite.

We waited while she passed;
It was a narrow time,
Too jostled were our souls to speak,
At length the notice came.

She mentioned, and forgot;
Then lightly as a reed
Bent to the water, shivered scarce,
Consented, and was dead.

And we, we placed the hair,
And drew the head erect;
And then an awful leisure was,
Our faith to regulate.





XXI.

THE FIRST LESSON.

Not in this world to see his face
Sounds long, until I read the place
Where this is said to be
But just the primer to a life
Unopened, rare, upon the shelf,
Clasped yet to him and me.

And yet, my primer suits me so
I would not choose a book to know
Than that, be sweeter wise;
Might some one else so learned be,
And leave me just my A B C,
Himself could have the skies.





XXII.

The bustle in a house
The morning after death
Is solemnest of industries
Enacted upon earth, —

The sweeping up the heart,
And putting love away
We shall not want to use again
Until eternity.





XXIII.

I reason, earth is short,
And anguish absolute,
And many hurt;
But what of that?

I reason, we could die:
The best vitality
Cannot excel decay;
But what of that?

I reason that in heaven
Somehow, it will be even,
Some new equation given;
But what of that?





XXIV.

Afraid? Of whom am I afraid?
Not death; for who is he?
The porter of my father's lodge
As much abasheth me.

Of life? 'T were odd I fear a thing
That comprehendeth me
In one or more existences
At Deity's decree.

Of resurrection? Is the east
Afraid to trust the morn
With her fastidious forehead?
As soon impeach my crown!





XXV.

DYING.

The sun kept setting, setting still;
No hue of afternoon
Upon the village I perceived, —
From house to house 't was noon.

The dusk kept dropping, dropping still;
No dew upon the grass,
But only on my forehead stopped,
And wandered in my face.

My feet kept drowsing, drowsing still,
My fingers were awake;
Yet why so little sound myself
Unto my seeming make?

How well I knew the light before!
I could not see it now.
'T is dying, I am doing; but
I'm not afraid to know.





XXVI.

Two swimmers wrestled on the spar
Until the morning sun,
When one turned smiling to the land.
O God, the other one!

The stray ships passing spied a face
Upon the waters borne,
With eyes in death still begging raised,
And hands beseeching thrown.





XXVII.

THE CHARIOT.

Because I could not stop for Death,
He kindly stopped for me;
The carriage held but just ourselves
And Immortality.

We slowly drove, he knew no haste,
And I had put away
My labor, and my leisure too,
For his civility.

We passed the school where children played,
Their lessons scarcely done;
We passed the fields of gazing grain,
We passed the setting sun.

We paused before a house that seemed
A swelling of the ground;
The roof was scarcely visible,
The cornice but a mound.

Since then 't is centuries; but each
Feels shorter than the day
I first surmised the horses' heads
Were toward eternity.





XXVIII.

She went as quiet as the dew
From a familiar flower.
Not like the dew did she return
At the accustomed hour!

She dropt as softly as a star
From out my summer's eve;
Less skilful than Leverrier
It's sorer to believe!





XXIX.

RESURGAM.

At last to be identified!
At last, the lamps upon thy side,
The rest of life to see!
Past midnight, past the morning star!
Past sunrise! Ah! what leagues there are
Between our feet and day!





XXX.

Except to heaven, she is nought;
Except for angels, lone;
Except to some wide-wandering bee,
A flower superfluous blown;

Except for winds, provincial;
Except by butterflies,
Unnoticed as a single dew
That on the acre lies.

The smallest housewife in the grass,
Yet take her from the lawn,
And somebody has lost the face
That made existence home!





XXXI.

Death is a dialogue between
The spirit and the dust.
"Dissolve," says Death. The Spirit, "Sir,
I have another trust."

Death doubts it, argues from the ground.
The Spirit turns away,
Just laying off, for evidence,
An overcoat of clay.





XXXII.

It was too late for man,
But early yet for God;
Creation impotent to help,
But prayer remained our side.

How excellent the heaven,
When earth cannot be had;
How hospitable, then, the face
Of our old neighbor, God!





XXXIII.

ALONG THE POTOMAC.

When I was small, a woman died.
To-day her only boy
Went up from the Potomac,
His face all victory,

To look at her; how slowly
The seasons must have turned
Till bullets clipt an angle,
And he passed quickly round!

If pride shall be in Paradise
I never can decide;
Of their imperial conduct,
No person testified.

But proud in apparition,
That woman and her boy
Pass back and forth before my brain,
As ever in the sky.





XXXIV.

The daisy follows soft the sun,
And when his golden walk is done,
    Sits shyly at his feet.
He, waking, finds the flower near.
"Wherefore, marauder, art thou here?"
    "Because, sir, love is sweet!"

We are the flower, Thou the sun!
Forgive us, if as days decline,
    We nearer steal to Thee, —
Enamoured of the parting west,
The peace, the flight, the amethyst,
    Night's possibility!





XXXV.

EMANCIPATION.

No rack can torture me,
My soul's at liberty
Behind this mortal bone
There knits a bolder one

You cannot prick with saw,
Nor rend with scymitar.
Two bodies therefore be;
Bind one, and one will flee.

The eagle of his nest
No easier divest
And gain the sky,
Than mayest thou,

Except thyself may be
Thine enemy;
Captivity is consciousness,
So's liberty.





XXXVI.

LOST.

I lost a world the other day.
Has anybody found?
You'll know it by the row of stars
Around its forehead bound.

A rich man might not notice it;
Yet to my frugal eye
Of more esteem than ducats.
Oh, find it, sir, for me!





XXXVII.

If I shouldn't be alive
When the robins come,
Give the one in red cravat
A memorial crumb.

If I couldn't thank you,
Being just asleep,
You will know I'm trying
With my granite lip!





XXXVIII.

Sleep is supposed to be,
By souls of sanity,
The shutting of the eye.

Sleep is the station grand
Down which on either hand
The hosts of witness stand!

Morn is supposed to be,
By people of degree,
The breaking of the day.

Morning has not occurred!
That shall aurora be
East of eternity;

One with the banner gay,
One in the red array, —
That is the break of day.





XXXIX.

I shall know why, when time is over,
And I have ceased to wonder why;
Christ will explain each separate anguish
In the fair schoolroom of the sky.

He will tell me what Peter promised,
And I, for wonder at his woe,
I shall forget the drop of anguish
That scalds me now, that scalds me now.





XL.

I never lost as much but twice,
And that was in the sod;
Twice have I stood a beggar
Before the door of God!

Angels, twice descending,
Reimbursed my store.
Burglar, banker, father,
I am poor once more!







 

 


POEMS

by EMILY DICKINSON

Second Series

 

 

Edited by two of her friends

MABEL LOOMIS TODD and T.W. HIGGINSON

 

 

PREFACE

The eagerness with which the first volume of Emily Dickinson's poems has been read shows very clearly that all our alleged modern artificiality does not prevent a prompt appreciation of the qualities of directness and simplicity in approaching the greatest themes,—life and love and death. That "irresistible needle-touch," as one of her best critics has called it, piercing at once the very core of a thought, has found a response as wide and sympathetic as it has been unexpected even to those who knew best her compelling power. This second volume, while open to the same criticism as to form with its predecessor, shows also the same shining beauties.

Although Emily Dickinson had been in the habit of sending occasional poems to friends and correspondents, the full extent of her writing was by no means imagined by them. Her friend "H.H." must at least have suspected it, for in a letter dated 5th September, 1884, she wrote:—

MY DEAR FRIEND,— What portfolios full of verses you must have! It is a cruel wrong to your "day and generation" that you will not give them light.

If such a thing should happen as that I should outlive you, I wish you would make me your literary legatee and executor. Surely after you are what is called "dead" you will be willing that the poor ghosts you have left behind should be cheered and pleased by your verses, will you not? You ought to be. I do not think we have a right to withhold from the world a word or a thought any more than a deed which might help a single soul. . . .

    Truly yours,

        HELEN JACKSON.

The "portfolios" were found, shortly after Emily Dickinson's death, by her sister and only surviving housemate. Most of the poems had been carefully copied on sheets of note-paper, and tied in little fascicules, each of six or eight sheets. While many of them bear evidence of having been thrown off at white heat, still more had received thoughtful revision. There is the frequent addition of rather perplexing foot-notes, affording large choice of words and phrases. And in the copies which she sent to friends, sometimes one form, sometimes another, is found to have been used. Without important exception, her friends have generously placed at the disposal of the Editors any poems they had received from her; and these have given the obvious advantage of comparison among several renderings of the same verse.

To what further rigorous pruning her verses would have been subjected had she published them herself, we cannot know. They should be regarded in many cases as merely the first strong and suggestive sketches of an artist, intended to be embodied at some time in the finished picture.

Emily Dickinson appears to have written her first poems in the winter of 1862. In a letter to one of the present Editors the April following, she says, "I made no verse, but one or two, until this winter."

The handwriting was at first somewhat like the delicate, running Italian hand of our elder gentlewomen; but as she advanced in breadth of thought, it grew bolder and more abrupt, until in her latest years each letter stood distinct and separate from its fellows. In most of her poems, particularly the later ones, everything by way of punctuation was discarded, except numerous dashes; and all important words began with capitals. The effect of a page of her more recent manuscript is exceedingly quaint and strong. The fac-simile given in the present volume is from one of the earlier transition periods. Although there is nowhere a date, the handwriting makes it possible to arrange the poems with general chronologic accuracy.

As a rule, the verses were without titles; but "A Country Burial," "A Thunder-Storm," "The Humming-Bird," and a few others were named by their author, frequently at the end,—sometimes only in the accompanying note, if sent to a friend.

The variation of readings, with the fact that she often wrote in pencil and not always clearly, have at times thrown a good deal of responsibility upon her Editors. But all interference not absolutely inevitable has been avoided. The very roughness of her rendering is part of herself, and not lightly to be touched; for it seems in many cases that she intentionally avoided the smoother and more usual rhymes.

Like impressionist pictures, or Wagner's rugged music, the very absence of conventional form challenges attention. In Emily Dickinson's exacting hands, the especial, intrinsic fitness of a particular order of words might not be sacrificed to anything virtually extrinsic; and her verses all show a strange cadence of inner rhythmical music. Lines are always daringly constructed, and the "thought-rhyme" appears frequently,—appealing, indeed, to an unrecognized sense more elusive than hearing.

Emily Dickinson scrutinized everything with clear-eyed frankness. Every subject was proper ground for legitimate study, even the sombre facts of death and burial, and the unknown life beyond. She touches these themes sometimes lightly, sometimes almost humorously, more often with weird and peculiar power; but she is never by any chance frivolous or trivial. And while, as one critic has said, she may exhibit toward God "an Emersonian self-possession," it was because she looked upon all life with a candor as unprejudiced as it is rare.

She had tried society and the world, and found them lacking. She was not an invalid, and she lived in seclusion from no love-disappointment. Her life was the normal blossoming of a nature introspective to a high degree, whose best thought could not exist in pretence.

Storm, wind, the wild March sky, sunsets and dawns; the birds and bees, butterflies and flowers of her garden, with a few trusted human friends, were sufficient companionship. The coming of the first robin was a jubilee beyond crowning of monarch or birthday of pope; the first red leaf hurrying through "the altered air," an epoch. Immortality was close about her; and while never morbid or melancholy, she lived in its presence.

    MABEL LOOMIS TODD.

    AMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS,

    August, 1891.

My nosegays are for captives;
    Dim, long-expectant eyes,
Fingers denied the plucking,
    Patient till paradise,

To such, if they should whisper
    Of morning and the moor,
They bear no other errand,
    And I, no other prayer.








I. LIFE.





I.

I'm nobody! Who are you?
Are you nobody, too?
Then there 's a pair of us — don't tell!
They 'd banish us, you know.

How dreary to be somebody!
How public, like a frog
To tell your name the livelong day
To an admiring bog!





II.

I bring an unaccustomed wine
To lips long parching, next to mine,
And summon them to drink.

Crackling with fever, they essay;
I turn my brimming eyes away,
And come next hour to look.

The hands still hug the tardy glass;
The lips I would have cooled, alas!
Are so superfluous cold,

I would as soon attempt to warm
The bosoms where the frost has lain
Ages beneath the mould.

Some other thirsty there may be
To whom this would have pointed me
Had it remained to speak.

And so I always bear the cup
If, haply, mine may be the drop
Some pilgrim thirst to slake, —

If, haply, any say to me,
"Unto the little, unto me,"
When I at last awake.





III.

The nearest dream recedes, unrealized.
       The heaven we chase
       Like the June bee
       Before the school-boy
       Invites the race;
       Stoops to an easy clover —
Dips — evades — teases — deploys;
       Then to the royal clouds
       Lifts his light pinnace
       Heedless of the boy
Staring, bewildered, at the mocking sky.

       Homesick for steadfast honey,
       Ah! the bee flies not
That brews that rare variety.





IV.

We play at paste,
Till qualified for pearl,
Then drop the paste,
And deem ourself a fool.
The shapes, though, were similar,
And our new hands
Learned gem-tactics
Practising sands.





V.

I found the phrase to every thought
I ever had, but one;
And that defies me, — as a hand
Did try to chalk the sun

To races nurtured in the dark; —
How would your own begin?
Can blaze be done in cochineal,
Or noon in mazarin?





VI.

HOPE.

Hope is the thing with feathers
That perches in the soul,
And sings the tune without the words,
And never stops at all,

And sweetest in the gale is heard;
And sore must be the storm
That could abash the little bird
That kept so many warm.

I 've heard it in the chillest land,
And on the strangest sea;
Yet, never, in extremity,
It asked a crumb of me.





VII.

THE WHITE HEAT.

Dare you see a soul at the white heat?
    Then crouch within the door.
Red is the fire's common tint;
    But when the vivid ore

Has sated flame's conditions,
    Its quivering substance plays
Without a color but the light
    Of unanointed blaze.

Least village boasts its blacksmith,
    Whose anvil's even din
Stands symbol for the finer forge
    That soundless tugs within,

Refining these impatient ores
    With hammer and with blaze,
Until the designated light
    Repudiate the forge.





VIII.

TRIUMPHANT.

Who never lost, are unprepared
A coronet to find;
Who never thirsted, flagons
And cooling tamarind.

Who never climbed the weary league —
Can such a foot explore
The purple territories
On Pizarro's shore?

How many legions overcome?
The emperor will say.
How many colors taken
On Revolution Day?

How many bullets bearest?
The royal scar hast thou?
Angels, write "Promoted"
On this soldier's brow!





IX.

THE TEST.

I can wade grief,
Whole pools of it, —
I 'm used to that.
But the least push of joy
Breaks up my feet,
And I tip — drunken.
Let no pebble smile,
'T was the new liquor, —
That was all!

Power is only pain,
Stranded, through discipline,
Till weights will hang.
Give balm to giants,
And they 'll wilt, like men.
Give Himmaleh, —
They 'll carry him!





X.

ESCAPE.

I never hear the word "escape"
Without a quicker blood,
A sudden expectation,
A flying attitude.

I never hear of prisons broad
By soldiers battered down,
But I tug childish at my bars, —
Only to fail again!






XI.

COMPENSATION.

For each ecstatic instant
We must an anguish pay
In keen and quivering ratio
To the ecstasy.

For each beloved hour
Sharp pittances of years,
Bitter contested farthings
And coffers heaped with tears.





XII.

THE MARTYRS.

Through the straight pass of suffering
The martyrs even trod,
Their feet upon temptation,
Their faces upon God.

A stately, shriven company;
Convulsion playing round,
Harmless as streaks of meteor
Upon a planet's bound.

Their faith the everlasting troth;
Their expectation fair;
The needle to the north degree
Wades so, through polar air.





XIII.

A PRAYER.

I meant to have but modest needs,
Such as content, and heaven;
Within my income these could lie,
And life and I keep even.

But since the last included both,
It would suffice my prayer
But just for one to stipulate,
And grace would grant the pair.

And so, upon this wise I prayed, —
Great Spirit, give to me
A heaven not so large as yours,
But large enough for me.

A smile suffused Jehovah's face;
The cherubim withdrew;
Grave saints stole out to look at me,
And showed their dimples, too.

I left the place with all my might, —
My prayer away I threw;
The quiet ages picked it up,
And Judgment twinkled, too,

That one so honest be extant
As take the tale for true
That "Whatsoever you shall ask,
Itself be given you."

But I, grown shrewder, scan the skies
With a suspicious air, —
As children, swindled for the first,
All swindlers be, infer.





XIV.

The thought beneath so slight a film
Is more distinctly seen, —
As laces just reveal the surge,
Or mists the Apennine.





XV.

The soul unto itself
Is an imperial friend, —
Or the most agonizing spy
An enemy could send.

Secure against its own,
No treason it can fear;
Itself its sovereign, of itself
The soul should stand in awe.





XVI.

Surgeons must be very careful
When they take the knife!
Underneath their fine incisions
Stirs the culprit, — Life!





XVII.

THE RAILWAY TRAIN.

I like to see it lap the miles,
And lick the valleys up,
And stop to feed itself at tanks;
And then, prodigious, step

Around a pile of mountains,
And, supercilious, peer
In shanties by the sides of roads;
And then a quarry pare

To fit its sides, and crawl between,
Complaining all the while
In horrid, hooting stanza;
Then chase itself down hill

And neigh like Boanerges;
Then, punctual as a star,
Stop — docile and omnipotent —
At its own stable door.





XVIII.

THE SHOW.

The show is not the show,
But they that go.
Menagerie to me
My neighbor be.
Fair play —
Both went to see.





XIX.

Delight becomes pictorial
When viewed through pain, —
More fair, because impossible
That any gain.

The mountain at a given distance
In amber lies;
Approached, the amber flits a little, —
And that 's the skies!





XX.

A thought went up my mind to-day
That I have had before,
But did not finish, — some way back,
I could not fix the year,

Nor where it went, nor why it came
The second time to me,
Nor definitely what it was,
Have I the art to say.

But somewhere in my soul, I know
I 've met the thing before;
It just reminded me — 't was all —
And came my way no more.





XXI.

Is Heaven a physician?
They say that He can heal;
But medicine posthumous
    Is unavailable.

Is Heaven an exchequer?
    They speak of what we owe;
But that negotiation
    I 'm not a party to.





XXII.

THE RETURN.

Though I get home how late, how late!
So I get home, 't will compensate.
Better will be the ecstasy
That they have done expecting me,
When, night descending, dumb and dark,
They hear my unexpected knock.
Transporting must the moment be,
Brewed from decades of agony!

To think just how the fire will burn,
Just how long-cheated eyes will turn
To wonder what myself will say,
And what itself will say to me,
Beguiles the centuries of way!





XXIII.

A poor torn heart, a tattered heart,
That sat it down to rest,
Nor noticed that the ebbing day
Flowed silver to the west,
Nor noticed night did soft descend
Nor constellation burn,
Intent upon the vision
Of latitudes unknown.

The angels, happening that way,
This dusty heart espied;
Tenderly took it up from toil
And carried it to God.
There, — sandals for the barefoot;
There, — gathered from the gales,
Do the blue havens by the hand
Lead the wandering sails.





XXIV.

TOO MUCH.

I should have been too glad, I see,
Too lifted for the scant degree
    Of life's penurious round;
My little circuit would have shamed
This new circumference, have blamed
    The homelier time behind.

I should have been too saved, I see,
Too rescued; fear too dim to me
    That I could spell the prayer
I knew so perfect yesterday, —
That scalding one, "Sabachthani,"
    Recited fluent here.

Earth would have been too much, I see,
And heaven not enough for me;
    I should have had the joy
Without the fear to justify, —
The palm without the Calvary;
    So, Saviour, crucify.

Defeat whets victory, they say;
The reefs in old Gethsemane
    Endear the shore beyond.
'T is beggars banquets best define;
'T is thirsting vitalizes wine, —
    Faith faints to understand.





XXV.

SHIPWRECK.

It tossed and tossed, —
A little brig I knew, —
O'ertook by blast,
It spun and spun,
And groped delirious, for morn.

It slipped and slipped,
As one that drunken stepped;
Its white foot tripped,
Then dropped from sight.

Ah, brig, good-night
To crew and you;
The ocean's heart too smooth, too blue,
To break for you.





XXVI.

Victory comes late,
And is held low to freezing lips
Too rapt with frost
To take it.
How sweet it would have tasted,
Just a drop!
Was God so economical?
His table 's spread too high for us
Unless we dine on tip-toe.
Crumbs fit such little mouths,
Cherries suit robins;
The eagle's golden breakfast
Strangles them.
God keeps his oath to sparrows,
Who of little love
Know how to starve!





XXVII.

ENOUGH.

God gave a loaf to every bird,
But just a crumb to me;
I dare not eat it, though I starve, —
My poignant luxury
To own it, touch it, prove the feat
That made the pellet mine, —
Too happy in my sparrow chance
For ampler coveting.

It might be famine all around,
I could not miss an ear,
Such plenty smiles upon my board,
My garner shows so fair.
I wonder how the rich may feel, —
An Indiaman — an Earl?
I deem that I with but a crumb
Am sovereign of them all.





XXVIII.

Experiment to me
Is every one I meet.
If it contain a kernel?
The figure of a nut

Presents upon a tree,
Equally plausibly;
But meat within is requisite,
To squirrels and to me.





XXIX.

MY COUNTRY'S WARDROBE.

My country need not change her gown,
Her triple suit as sweet
As when 't was cut at Lexington,
And first pronounced "a fit."

Great Britain disapproves "the stars;"
Disparagement discreet, —
There 's something in their attitude
That taunts her bayonet.





XXX.

Faith is a fine invention
For gentlemen who see;
But microscopes are prudent
In an emergency!





XXXI.

Except the heaven had come so near,
So seemed to choose my door,
The distance would not haunt me so;
I had not hoped before.

But just to hear the grace depart
I never thought to see,
Afflicts me with a double loss;
'T is lost, and lost to me.





XXXII.

Portraits are to daily faces
As an evening west
To a fine, pedantic sunshine
In a satin vest.





XXXIII.

THE DUEL.

I took my power in my hand.
And went against the world;
'T was not so much as David had,
But I was twice as bold.

I aimed my pebble, but myself
Was all the one that fell.
Was it Goliath was too large,
Or only I too small?





XXXIV.

A shady friend for torrid days
Is easier to find
Than one of higher temperature
For frigid hour of mind.

The vane a little to the east
Scares muslin souls away;
If broadcloth breasts are firmer
Than those of organdy,

Who is to blame? The weaver?
Ah! the bewildering thread!
The tapestries of paradise
So notelessly are made!





XXXV.

THE GOAL.

Each life converges to some centre
Expressed or still;
Exists in every human nature
A goal,

Admitted scarcely to itself, it may be,
Too fair
For credibility's temerity
To dare.

Adored with caution, as a brittle heaven,
To reach
Were hopeless as the rainbow's raiment
To touch,

Yet persevered toward, surer for the distance;
How high
Unto the saints' slow diligence
The sky!

Ungained, it may be, by a life's low venture,
But then,
Eternity enables the endeavoring
Again.





XXXVI.

SIGHT.

Before I got my eye put out,
I liked as well to see
As other creatures that have eyes,
And know no other way.

But were it told to me, to-day,
That I might have the sky
For mine, I tell you that my heart
Would split, for size of me.

The meadows mine, the mountains mine, —
All forests, stintless stars,
As much of noon as I could take
Between my finite eyes.

The motions of the dipping birds,
The lightning's jointed road,
For mine to look at when I liked, —
The news would strike me dead!

So safer, guess, with just my soul
Upon the window-pane
Where other creatures put their eyes,
Incautious of the sun.





XXXVII.

Talk with prudence to a beggar
Of 'Potosi' and the mines!
Reverently to the hungry
Of your viands and your wines!

Cautious, hint to any captive
You have passed enfranchised feet!
Anecdotes of air in dungeons
Have sometimes proved deadly sweet!





XXXVIII.

THE PREACHER.

He preached upon "breadth" till it argued him narrow, —
The broad are too broad to define;
And of "truth" until it proclaimed him a liar, —
The truth never flaunted a sign.

Simplicity fled from his counterfeit presence
As gold the pyrites would shun.
What confusion would cover the innocent Jesus
To meet so enabled a man!





XXXIX.

Good night! which put the candle out?
A jealous zephyr, not a doubt.
    Ah! friend, you little knew
How long at that celestial wick
The angels labored diligent;
    Extinguished, now, for you!

It might have been the lighthouse spark
Some sailor, rowing in the dark,
    Had importuned to see!
It might have been the waning lamp
That lit the drummer from the camp
    To purer reveille!





XL.

When I hoped I feared,
Since I hoped I dared;
Everywhere alone
As a church remain;
Spectre cannot harm,
Serpent cannot charm;
He deposes doom,
Who hath suffered him.





XLI.

DEED.

A deed knocks first at thought,
And then it knocks at will.
That is the manufacturing spot,
And will at home and well.

It then goes out an act,
Or is entombed so still
That only to the ear of God
Its doom is audible.





XLII.

TIME'S LESSON.

Mine enemy is growing old, —
I have at last revenge.
The palate of the hate departs;
If any would avenge, —

Let him be quick, the viand flits,
It is a faded meat.
Anger as soon as fed is dead;
'T is starving makes it fat.





XLIII.

REMORSE.

Remorse is memory awake,
Her companies astir, —
A presence of departed acts
At window and at door.

It's past set down before the soul,
And lighted with a match,
Perusal to facilitate
Of its condensed despatch.

Remorse is cureless, — the disease
Not even God can heal;
For 't is his institution, —
The complement of hell.





XLIV.

THE SHELTER.

The body grows outside, —
The more convenient way, —
That if the spirit like to hide,
Its temple stands alway

Ajar, secure, inviting;
It never did betray
The soul that asked its shelter
In timid honesty.





XLV.

Undue significance a starving man attaches
To food
Far off; he sighs, and therefore hopeless,
And therefore good.

Partaken, it relieves indeed, but proves us
That spices fly
In the receipt. It was the distance
Was savory.





XLVI.

Heart not so heavy as mine,
Wending late home,
As it passed my window
Whistled itself a tune, —

A careless snatch, a ballad,
A ditty of the street;
Yet to my irritated ear
An anodyne so sweet,

It was as if a bobolink,
Sauntering this way,
Carolled and mused and carolled,
Then bubbled slow away.

It was as if a chirping brook
Upon a toilsome way
Set bleeding feet to minuets
Without the knowing why.

To-morrow, night will come again,
Weary, perhaps, and sore.
Ah, bugle, by my window,
I pray you stroll once more!





XLVII.

I many times thought peace had come,
When peace was far away;
As wrecked men deem they sight the land
At centre of the sea,

And struggle slacker, but to prove,
As hopelessly as I,
How many the fictitious shores
Before the harbor lie.





XLVIII.

Unto my books so good to turn
Far ends of tired days;
It half endears the abstinence,
And pain is missed in praise.

As flavors cheer retarded guests
With banquetings to be,
So spices stimulate the time
Till my small library.

It may be wilderness without,
Far feet of failing men,
But holiday excludes the night,
And it is bells within.

I thank these kinsmen of the shelf;
Their countenances bland
Enamour in prospective,
And satisfy, obtained.





XLIX.

This merit hath the worst, —
It cannot be again.
When Fate hath taunted last
And thrown her furthest stone,

The maimed may pause and breathe,
And glance securely round.
The deer invites no longer
Than it eludes the hound.





L.

HUNGER.

I had been hungry all the years;
My noon had come, to dine;
I, trembling, drew the table near,
And touched the curious wine.

'T was this on tables I had seen,
When turning, hungry, lone,
I looked in windows, for the wealth
I could not hope to own.

I did not know the ample bread,
'T was so unlike the crumb
The birds and I had often shared
In Nature's dining-room.

The plenty hurt me, 't was so new, —
Myself felt ill and odd,
As berry of a mountain bush
Transplanted to the road.

Nor was I hungry; so I found
That hunger was a way
Of persons outside windows,
The entering takes away.





LI.

I gained it so,
       By climbing slow,
By catching at the twigs that grow
Between the bliss and me.
       It hung so high,
       As well the sky
       Attempt by strategy.


I said I gained it, —
       This was all.
Look, how I clutch it,
       Lest it fall,
And I a pauper go;
Unfitted by an instant's grace
For the contented beggar's face
I wore an hour ago.





LII.

To learn the transport by the pain,
As blind men learn the sun;
To die of thirst, suspecting
That brooks in meadows run;

To stay the homesick, homesick feet
Upon a foreign shore
Haunted by native lands, the while,
And blue, beloved air —

This is the sovereign anguish,
This, the signal woe!
These are the patient laureates
Whose voices, trained below,

Ascend in ceaseless carol,
Inaudible, indeed,
To us, the duller scholars
Of the mysterious bard!





LIII.

RETURNING.

I years had been from home,
And now, before the door,
I dared not open, lest a face
I never saw before

Stare vacant into mine
And ask my business there.
My business, — just a life I left,
Was such still dwelling there?

I fumbled at my nerve,
I scanned the windows near;
The silence like an ocean rolled,
And broke against my ear.

I laughed a wooden laugh
That I could fear a door,
Who danger and the dead had faced,
But never quaked before.

I fitted to the latch
My hand, with
