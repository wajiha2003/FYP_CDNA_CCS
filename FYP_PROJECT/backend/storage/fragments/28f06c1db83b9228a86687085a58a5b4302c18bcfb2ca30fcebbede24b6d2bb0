Mama please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside I just can't deny, I love the guy He is a villain by the devil's law
He is a killer just for fun, fun, fun, fun

It's time for make-up, perfect smile
It's you they're all waiting for
They go
Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?
And they say She's so lucky, she's a star
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night? Lost in an image, in a dream
But there's no one there to wake her up
And the world is spinning, and she keeps on winning
But tell me what happens when it stops?
They go

And they say She's so lucky, she's a star

Oh my god here she comes Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?
She is so lucky, but why does she cry?
If there is nothing missing in her life
Why do tears come at night? And they say she's so lucky, she's a star
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life

I, I'm stronger Lately I've been stuck imagining
What I wanna do and what I really think
Time to blow out Be a little inappropriate
'Cause I know that everybody's thinking it
When the light's out Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa Lately people got me all tied up
There's a countdown waiting for me to erupt
Time to blow out I've been told do what you do with it
We keep both my hands above the blanket
When the light's out Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa Baby, I'm so into you
You've got that something, what can I do
Baby, you spin me around, oh
The earth is movin', but I can't feel the ground
Every time you look at me
My heart is jumpin', it's easy to see
Loving you means so much more
More than anything I ever felt before [Chorus]
You drive me crazy
I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Crazy, but it feels alright
Baby thinkin' of you keeps me up all night
Tell me, you're so into me
That I'm the only one you will see
Tell me I'm not in the blue, oh
That I'm not wastin'
My feelins on you
Loving you means so much more
More than anything I ever felt before
Chorus
Crazy, I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Crazy, but it feels alright
Every day and every night
Chorus Hey, over there
Please, forgive me
If I'm comin' on too strong
Hate to stare
But, you're winnin'
And they're playin' my favorite song
So, come here
A little closer
Wanna whisper in your ear
Make it clear
A little question
Wanna know just how you feel If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?
'Cause, you feel like paradise
And I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me? Hey, you might think
That I'm crazy
But, you know I'm just your type
I might be
Little hazy
But, you just cannot deny
There's a spark
In between us
When we're dancin' on the floor
I want more
Wanna see it
So, I'm askin' you tonight If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?
'Cause, you feel like paradise
And I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me? If I said I want your body
Would you hold it against me?
Yeah, uh-huh, oh Give me somethin' good
Don't wanna wait
I want it now
Pop it like a hood
And show me how you work it out Alright
If I said my heart was beating loud
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me? If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?
'Cause, you feel like paradise
And I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me? I used to think
I had the answers to everything
But now I know
That life doesn't always
Go my way, yeah
Feels like I'm caught in the middle
That's when I realize I'm not a girl
Not yet a woman
All I need is time
A moment that is mine
While I'm in between
I'm not a girl There is no need to protect me
It's time that I
Learn to face up to this on my own
I've seen so much more than you know now
So don't tell me to shut my eyes I'm not a girl
Not yet a woman
All I need is time
A moment that is mine
While I'm in between
I'm not a girl But if you look at me closely
You will see it in my eyes

We're just so pretty! Hey, don't you know that it's always the same?

They can laugh, but they don't get the jokes

All around the world, pretty girls
Jump the line, to the front
Do what we like, get what we want
We're just so pretty! Tell me, is it true that these men are from Mars?
Is that why they be acting bizarre?
Every time I walk out of my house it's like, "hey, baby!"
They don't see me rolling my eyes
They buzzing around me like flies
They got one thing on their minds
(Some things don't change) (The girls roll up)

But busy Iggy wouldn't even give 'em one more glance
See, enter in line between the beauty and a beast
Slim waist, thick cake, the whole world want a piece
Bad girl, good (ooh) would make you lose your mind
All of the boys begging Britney, hit 'em one more time

How was I to know I'd miss you so?
Loneliness up ahead, emptiness behind
Where do I go? And you didn't hear
All my joy through my tears
All my hopes through my fears
Did you now, still I miss you somehow From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
You were my first love
You were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose
From the bottom of my broken heart
Even though time may find me somebody new
You were my real love, I never knew love
'Til there was you
From the bottom of my broken heart Baby, I said
Please stay, give our love a chance for one more day
We could have worked things out
Taking time is what love's all about But you put a dart through my dreams
Through my heart
And I'm back where I started again
Never thought it would end From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
You were my first love,
You were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose
From the bottom of my broken heart
Even though time may find me somebody new
You were my real love, I never knew love
'Til there was you
From the bottom of my broken heart You promised yourself
But to somebody else
And you made it so perfectly clear
Still I wish you were here now From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
You were my first love
You were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose From the bottom of my broken heart
Even though time may find me somebody new
You were my real love, I never knew love
'Til there was you
From the bottom of my broken heart Never look back, we said
How was I to know I'd miss you so? For whatever reason
I feel like I've been wanting you all my life
You don't understand?
I'm so glad we're at the same place
At the same time, it's over now
I spotted you dancing
You made all the girls stare
Those lips and your brown eyes
And the sexy hair
I should shake my thing
I make the world want you
Tell your boys you'll be back
I wanna see what you can do What would it take for you to just leave with me?
Not trying to sound conceited
But me and you we're meant to be
You're a sexy guy, I'm a nice girl (don't you know?)
Let's turn this dance floor into our own little nasty world Boys, sometimes a girl just needs one (you know I need you)
Boys, to love her and to hold (I just want you to touch me)
Boys, and when a girl is with one
Boys, then she's in control Took the boy off the dance floor
Screaming in his ear
Must have said something 'bout me (what you say?)
Because he's looking over here
You looking at me with a sexy attitude
But the way your boys moving it
It puts me in the mood What would it take for you to just leave with me?
Not trying to sound conceited
But me and you were meant to be (don't you know?
You're a sexy guy, I'm a nice girl (don't you know?)

You're going to have to see through my perspective
I need to make mistakes just to learn who I am
And I don't want to be so damn protected There must be another way
Cause I believe in taking chances
But who am I to say
What a girl is to do?
God, I need some answers What am I to do with my life?
(You will find it out don't worry)
How am I supposed to know what's right?
(You just got to do it your way)
I can't help the way I feel
But my life has been so overprotected I'll tell them what I like, what I want, what I don't
But every time I do I stand corrected
Things that I've been told
I can't believe what I hear about the world, I realize
I'm overprotected There must be another way
Cause I believe in taking chances
But who am I to say
What a girl is to do?
God, I need some answers What am I to do with my life?
(You will find it out don't worry)
How am I supposed to know what's right?

I need space
(This is it, this is it) I don't need nobody telling me just what I wanna
What I, what, what, what I'm going to
Do about my destiny
I say no, no, nobody's telling me just
What, what, what I wanna do, do
I'm so fed up with people telling me to be
Someone else but me (Action!) What am I to do with my life?

How am I supposed to know what's right?
(You just got to do it your way)
I can't help the way I feel
But my life has been so overprotected There's a girl in the mirror
I wonder who she is
Sometimes I think I know her
Sometimes I really wish I did There's a story in her eyes
Lullabies and goodbyes
When she's looking back at me
I can tell her heart is broken easily 'Cause the girl in my mirror
Is crying out tonight
And there's nothing I can tell her
To make her feel alright Oh the girl in my mirror
Is crying 'cause of you
And I wish there was something
Something I could do If I could
I would tell her
Not to be afraid
The pain that she's feeling The sense of loneliness will fade
So dry your tears and rest assured
Love will find you like before
When she's looking back at me
I know nothing really works that easily 'Cause the girl in my mirror
Is crying in tonight
And there's nothing I can tell her
To make her feel alright Oh the girl in my mirror
Is crying 'cause of you
And I wish there was something
I wish there was something
Oh I wish there was something
I could do I can't believe it's what I see
That the girl in the mirror
The girl in the mirror
Is me I can't believe what I see (no....)
(The girl in my mirror)
The girl in my mirror is me
Ohh... is me 'Cause the girl in my mirror
Is crying out tonight
And there's nothing I can tell her
To make her feel alright Oh the girl in my mirror
Is crying 'cause of you
I wish there was something

Lost in the world out of me myself and I
Was lonely then like an alien
I tried but I never figured it out
Why I always felt like a stranger in a crowd
Ooh that was then like an alien But the stars in the sky look like home, take me home
And the light in your eyes lets me know I'm not alone Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone Crossed through the universe to get where you are
Travel the night riding on a shooting star
Was lonely then like an alien
Had to get used to the world I was on
While yet still unsure if I knew where I belong
Ooh That was then like an alien But the stars in the sky look like home, take me home
And the light in your eyes lets me know I'm not not alone Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone But the stars in the sky look like home, take me home
And the light in your eyes lets me know I'm not alone Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
(Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone - not alone not alone not alone) Ya!
Yeah... Aay, shorty.

Then she told me; Britney:

Oh baby, baby
Oops, you think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent You see my problem is this

Can't you see I'm a fool in so many ways
But to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
Oh baby, oh Oops, I did it again

Oh crazy (you make me feel alright)
But it feels alright
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night Nothing about you is typical
Nothing about you is predictable
You've got me all twisted and confused
(It's all new)
Up til now, I thought I knew love
Nothing to loose and its damaged cause
Patterns will fall as quick as I do, but now Bridges are burning
Baby I'm learning, a new way of thinking now
Love I can see, nothing will be, just like it was
Is that because? Baby you're so unusual
Didn't anyone tell you, you're supposed to, break my heart?
I expect you do, so why haven't you?
Maybe you're not even human cause
Only an angel can be so unusual
Sweet surprise, I could get used to
Unusual You Been so many things when I was someone else
Boxer in the ring trying to defend myself
In the private eye to see what's going on
(That's long gone)
When I'm with you, I can just be myself
You're always where you said you will be
Shocking cause I never knew love like this could exist Tables are turning
My heart is soaring, You'll never let me down
Answer my call, here after all
Never met anyone like you Baby you're so unusual
Didn't anyone tell you, you're supposed to, break my heart?
I expect you do, so why haven't you?
Maybe you're not even human cause
Only an angel can be so unusual
Sweet surprise, I could get used to
Unusual You Can't believe that I almost didn't try
When you call my name
Now everything has changed Baby you're so unusual
Didn't anyone tell you, you're supposed to, break my heart?
I expect you do, so why haven't you?
Maybe you're not even human cause
Only an angel can be so unusual
Sweet surprise, I could get used to
Unusual You Said you're gonna be here in a minute
Sitting in the mirror, getting pretty
Gotta look my best if we gonna break up
Gotta look my best if we gonna break up
I can hear you knocking at the front door
And I know exactly what you came for
Trying to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy
Trying to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy You
Touch me and it's breaking me down
And me down, and me down, and me down
I'm telling you, let's just give it up
And get down, and get down, and get down So come on
Won't you give me something to remember?

I sit and pray
And I will pull through, oh no yeah When you let go
Of all youve known
The butterflies fly
And you will see the rainbows
And all the love

So let go
Let go The touch of grass
The air

It will bring tears to your eyes
Maybe everything will be alright
So let go
You gotta let go Ive got a feeling
Right now
You feel it too
Oh, oh
This little song
Might be the one
That will tell us what to do
Oh, oh, ooh, ooh These tears are overflowing
And never knowing why
All these years weve been
Weve been hurting
We have to look inside
And try
To let go You gotta let go
To love, you gotta let go
If you really wanna love
You gotta let go French fingertips,
Red lips
Bitch is dangerous
Cotton candy kiss
Can't wait for my sugar rush Can't take it no more
I got to have more tonight
This feeling's so strong
I'm putting you on tonight Alright, let's go! Baby take a seat
Eyes on me this is my show
Your one and only pleasure
All decked in lace and leather
Fantasy, courtesy of me
Baby let's go
Watch me apply the pressure
All decked in lace and leather Heels 6 inch
Makes a boy wanna bite his lip
Look but don't touch
Unless you want to lose your innocence Can't take it no more
I got to have more tonight
This feelings so strong
I'm putting you on tonight Baby take a seat
Eyes on me this is my show
Your one and only pleasure
All decked in lace and leather

All decked in lace and leather Baby take a seat
Eyes on me this is my show
Your one and only pleasure
All decked in lace and leather
Fantasy, courtesy of me
Baby let's go
Watch me apply the pressure
All decked in lace and leather Breathe you out
Breathe you in
You keep coming back to tell me
You're the one who could have been
And my eyes see it all so clear
It was long ago and far away but it never disappears
I try to put it in the past
Hold on to myself and don't look back I don't wanna dream about
All the things that never were
Maybe I can live without
When I'm out from under
I don't wanna feel the pain
What good would it do me now
I'll get it all figured out
When I'm out from under
(From under, from under, from under, from under) So let me go
Just let me fly away
Let me feel the space between us growing deeper
And much darker every day
Watch me now and I'll be someone new
My heart will be unbroken
It will open up for everyone but you
Even when I cross the line
It's like a lie I've told a thousand times I don't wanna dream about
All the things that never were
Maybe I can live without
When I'm out from under
I don't wanna feel the pain
What good would it do me now
I'll get it all figured out
When I'm out from under
(From under, from under, from under, from under) And part of me still believes
When you say you're gonna stick around
And part of me still believes
We can find a way to work it out
But I know that we tried everything we could try
So let's just say goodbye
Forever I don't wanna dream about
All the things that never were
Maybe I can live without
When I'm out from under
I don't wanna feel the pain
What good would it do me now
I'll get it all figured out
When I'm out from under
(From under, from under, from under, from under) I don't wanna dream about
All the things that never were
Maybe I can live without
When I'm out from under
I don't wanna feel the pain
What good would it do me now
I'll get it all figured out
When I'm out from under
(From under, from under, from under, from under) From under, from under, from under, from under. I'm not ashamed of the things that I dream
I find myself flirting with the verge of obscene
Into the unknown, I will be bold
I'm going to places I can be out of control And I don't want to explain tonight
All the things I've tried to hide
I shut myself out from the world so I
Can draw the blinds and I'll teach myself to fly I love myself
It's not a sin
I can't control what's happenin' 'Cause I just discovered
Imagination's taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand From the small of my back and the arch of my feet
Lately I've been noticin' the beautiful me
I'm all in my skin and I'm not gonna wait
I'm into myself in the most precious way And I don't want to explain tonight
All the things I've tried to hide
I shut myself out from the world so I
Can draw the blinds and I'll teach myself to fly 'Cause I just discovered
Imagination's taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand There's a world undefined
And my body is mine
I won't be left behind
I'm already here 'Cause I just discovered
Imagination's taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand 'Cause I just discovered
Imagination's taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand Do you feel this
I know you feel this
Are you ready?
I don't think so Somebody give me my truck
So I can ride on the clouds
So I can turn up the bass like Somebody pass my guitar
So I can look like a star
And spend this cash like What'chu gonna do when the crowd goes a-yo?
Why you standin' on the wall?
Music startin' everywhere
So why don't you just move along? I see you lookin' at me

Will you love me tomorrow Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure

So tell me now, 'cause I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow

Kept his dick wet
With his same old safe bet
Me and my head high
And my tears dry
Get on without my guy
You went back to what you knew
So far removed from all that we went through
And I tread a troubled track
My odds are stacked
I'll go back to black We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to
I go back to us I love you much
It's not enough
You love blow, and I love puff
And life is like a pipe
And I'm a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to Black
Black
Black
Black
Black
Black
Black
I go back to
I go back to We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to black You should be stronger than me
You've been here seven years longer than me
Don't you know you supposed to be the man?
Not pale in comparison to who you think I am
You always want to talk it through, I don't care
I always have to comfort you when I'm there
But that's what I need you to do, stroke my hair
'Cause I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, and you my lady boy You should be stronger than me
But instead you're longer than frozen turkey
Why'd you always put me in control
All I need is for my man to live up to his role
You always want to talk it through, I'm okay
I always have to comfort you every day
But that's what I need you to do, are you gay?
'Cause I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, and you my lady boy He said "the respect I made you earn
Thought you had so many lessons to learn"
I said "You don't know what love is get a grip
Sound as if you're reading from some other tired script"
I'm not gonna meet your mother anytime
I just want to grip your body over mine
Please tell me why you think that's a crime
I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, and you my lady boy You should be stronger than me
You should be stronger than me
You should be stronger than me
You should be stronger than me They tried to make me go to rehab
I said, no, no, no
Yes, I been black
But when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time
And if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab
I won't go, go, go I'd rather be at home with a Ray
I ain't got seventy days
'Cause there's nothing, there's nothing you can teach me
That I can't learn from Mr. Hathaway I didn't get a lot in class
But I know we don't come in a shot glass They tried to make me go to rehab
I said, "no, no, no"
Yes, I been black
But when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time
And if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab
I won't go, go, go The man said, "why do you think you here?
I said, I got no idea.
I'm gonna, I'm gonna lose my baby
So I always keep a bottle near
He said, I just think you're depressed
This, me, yeah, baby, and the rest They tried to make me go to rehab
But I said, no, no, no
Yes, I been black
But when I come back, you'll know, know, know I don't ever want to drink again
I just, oh, I just need a friend
I'm not gonna spend ten weeks
Have everyone think I'm on the mend And it's not just my pride
It's just till these tears have dried They tried to make me go to rehab
I said, no, no, no
Yes, I been black
But when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time
And if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab
I won't go, go, go Well sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doing
And in my head I paint a picture 'Cause since I've come on home,
Well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over Valerie? Valerie
Valerie
Valerie Did you have to go to jail,
Put your house up for sale, did you get a good lawyer?
I hope you didn't catch a tan,
I hope you'll find the right man who'll fix it for ya
And are you shopping anywhere,
Changed the color of your hair, are you busy?
And did you have to pay that fine
You were dodging all the time, are you still dizzy? 'Cause since I've come on home,
Well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over Valerie? Valerie
Valerie
Valerie Well sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doing
And in my head I paint a picture 'Cause since I've come on home,
Well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over Valerie? Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie Why don't come over Valerie? Meet you downstairs in the bar and heard
Your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt
You say, "Why did you do it with him today?"
And sniff me out like I was Tanqueray 'Cause you're my fella, my guy
Hand me your Stella and fly
By the time I'm out the door
You tear me down like Roger Moore I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
You know that I'm no good Upstairs in bed with my ex-boy
He's in the place, but I can't get joy
Thinking of you in the final throes
This is when my buzzer goes Run out to meet your chips and pitter
You say when we're married 'cause you're not bitter
There'll be none of him no more
I cried for you on the kitchen floor I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
You know that I'm no good Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain
We're like how we were again
I'm in the tub, you're on the seat
Lick your lips as I soak my feet Then you notice little carpet burn
My stomach drops, and my guts churn
You shrug, and it's the worst
To truly stuck the knife in first I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
You know that I'm no good
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
Yeah, ya know that I'm no good All I can ever be to you is a darkness that we knew
And this regret I got accustomed to
Once it was so right
When we were at our height
Waiting for you in the hotel at night
I knew I hadn't met my match
But every moment we could snatch
I don't know why I got so attached
It's my responsibility
You don't owe nothing to me
But to walk away, I have no capacity He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown
And in your way
In this blue shade
My tears dry on their own I don't understand
Why do I stress the man
When there's so many bigger things at hand?
We could've never had it all
We had to hit a wall
So this is inevitable withdrawal
Even if I stop wanting you
And perspective pushes through
I'll be some next man's other woman soon
I cannot play my self again
I should just be my own best friend
Not fuck my self in the head with stupid men He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown
And in your way
In this blue shade
My tears dry on their own So we are history
Your shadow covers me
The sky above ablaze He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown
And in your way
In this blue shade
My tears dry on their own I wish I could sing no regrets
And no emotional debt
'Cause as we kissed goodbye, the sun sets
So we are history
Your shadow covers me
The sky above ablaze
That only lovers see He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown
And in your way
My blue shade
My tears dry on their own Whoa, he walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown
And in your way
My deep shade
My tears dry on their own He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown
And in your way
My deep shade
My tears dry For you I was the flame
Love is a losing game
Five story fire as you came
Love is losing game One I wished, I never played
Oh, what a mess we made
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game Played out by the band
Love is a losing hand
More than I could stand
Love is a losing hand Self-professed profound
Till the chips were down
Know you're a gambling man
Love is a losing hand Though I battled blind
Love is a fate resigned
Memories mar my mind
Love is a fate resigned Over futile odds
And laughed at by the gods
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game It's okay in the day
I'm staying busy
Tied up enough so I don't have to wonder where is he
Got so sick of crying
So just lately
When I catch myself, I do a one-eighty
I stay up, clean the house
At least I'm not drinking
Run around just so I don't have to think about thinking
That silent sense of content
That everyone gets
Just disappears 'soon as the sun sets He's fierce in my dreams, seizing my guts
He floats me with dread
Soaked in soul
He swims in my eyes by the bed
Pour myself over him
Moon spilling in
And I wake up alone If I was my heart
I'd rather be restless
The second I stop, the sleep catches up
And I'm breathless
'Cause this ache in my chest
As my day is done now
The dark covers me, and I cannot run now
My blood running cold
I stand before him (before him, I)
It's all I can do to assure him (assure him)
When he comes to me
I drip for him tonight
Drowning in me, we bathe under blue light He's fierce in my dreams, seizing my guts
He floats me with dread
Soaked in soul
He swims in my eyes by the bed
Pour myself over him
Moon spilling in
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone Tonight you're mine, completely
You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
Will you love me tomorrow Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic of your sighs
Will you still love me tomorrow Tonight with words unspoken
You said that I'm the only one, the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning star I'd like to know that your love
Is a love I can be sure of
So tell me now, 'cause I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow There I go, there I go, there I go, there I go
Pretty baby you are the soul, snaps my control
Such a funny thing but every time your near me
I never can behave
You give me a smile and I'm wrapped up in your magic
There's music all around me
Crazy music, music that keeps calling me so
Very close to you, turns me into your slave
Come on and do with me any little thing that you want to
Anything, baby just let me get next to you So am I insane or do I really see heaven in your eyes?
Bright as stars that shine up above you
In the clear blue sky, how I worry 'bout you
Just can't live my life without you
Baby come here, don't have no fear
Oh, is there wonder why
I'm really feeling in the mood for love So tell me why, stop to think about this weather, my dear
This little dream might fade away
There I go talking out of my head again baby won't you
Come and put our two hearts together
That would make me strong and brave
Oh, when we are one, I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
Now if there's a cloud up above us
Go on and let in rain
I'm sure our love together would endure a hurricane
Oh my baby won't you please let me love you
And get a release from this awful misery What is all this talk about loving me, my sweet
I am not afraid, not anymore, not like before
Don't you understand me, now baby please
Pull yourself together, do it soon
My soul's on fire, come on and take
I'll be what you make me, my darling Oh baby, you make me feel so good
Let me take you by the hand
Come let us visit out there
In that new promised land Maybe there we can find
A good place to use a lovin' state of mind
I'm so tired of being without it
And never known what love's about
James Moody would you come on hit me,
You can blow now if you want to, I'm through Nobody stands in between me and my man
It's me and Mr. Jones (me and Mr. Jones) What kind of fuckery is this?
You made me miss the Slick Rick gig (oh, Slick Rick)
And thought I didn't love you when I did (when I did)
Can't believe you played me out like that (ah) No, you ain't worth guest list
Plus one of all them girls you kiss (all them girls)
You can't keep lying to yourself like this (to yourself)
Can't believe you played yourself (out) like this Ruler's one thing, but come Brixton
Nobody stands in between me and my man
'Cause it's me and Mr. Jones (me and Mr. Jones) What kind of fuckery are we?
Nowadays you don't mean dick to me (dick to me)
I might let you make it up to me (make it up)
Who's playing Saturday? What kind of fuckery are you?
'Side from Sammy, you're my best black Jew
But I could swear that we were through (we were through)
I still want to wonder 'bout the things you do Mr. Destiny, nine and fourteen
Nobody stands in between me and my man
'Cause it's me and Mr. Jones
Yeah (me and Mr. Jones) (me and Mr. Jones) There's a saying old
Says that love is blind
Still we're often told
"Seek and ye shall find"
So I'm going to seek
A certain lad
I've had in mind Looking everywhere
Haven't found him yet
He's the big affair
I cannot forget
Only man I ever think
Of with regret I'd like
To add his initial
To my monogram
Tell me
Where is the shepherd
For this lost lamb? There's a somebody
I'm longin' to see
I hope that he turns
Out to be
Someone to watch over me I'm a little lamb
Who's lost in the wood
I know I could
Always be good
To one
Who'll watch over me Although he may
Not be the man some
Girls think
Of as handsome
To my heart
He carries the key Won't you tell him please
To put on some speed
Follow my lead
Oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me Won't you tell him please
To put on some speed
Follow my lead
Oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me
Someone to watch over me When will we get
The time to be
Just friends? It's never safe for us
Not even in the evening
'Cause I've been drinking
Not in the morning
When your shit works
It's always dangerous
When everybody's sleeping
And I've been thinking
Can we be alone?
Can we be alone? When will we get
The time to be
Just friends?
When will we get
The time to be
Just friends? And, no, I'm not ashamed
But the guilt will kill you
If she don't first

Thought we need to find a time
To just do this shit together

But that just hurts When will we get
The time to be
Just, just friends?

And I'll send all my loving to you I'll pretend that I'm kissing
The lips that I am missing
And hope that your dreams will come true And then while I'm away

All my loving, darling I'll be true
All my loving, all my loving
Ooh, all my loving, all my loving, I will send to you Her name is Cherry, we've just met
But already she knows me better than you
She understands me after eighteen years
And you still don't see me like you ought to do Maybe we could talk 'bout things
If you was made of wood and strings
While I love her every sound
I dunno how to turn you down And you're so thick and my patience thin
So I got me a new best friend
With a pickup that puts you to shame
And Cherry is her name And when I'm lonely, Cherry's there
And she plays along while I sing out my blues
I could be crying and you don't care
You won't call me back, you're stubborn as a mule Maybe we could talk 'bout things
If you was made of wood and strings
You might think I've gone too far
I'm talking 'bout my new guitar Wish I could say it breaks my heart
Like you did in the beginning
Its not that we grew apart
A nightingale no longer singing Its something I know you can't do
Separate sex with emotion
I sleep alone the sun comes up
Your still clinging to that notion Every thing is slowing down
River of no return
Recognize my every sound
There is nothing new to learn You'll never get my mind right
Like two ships passing in the night
In the night, in the night
Want the same thing where we lay
Otherwise mines a different way
A different way from where I'm going
Oh, its you again listen this isn't a reunion
So sorry if I turn my head
Yours is a familiar face
But that don't make your place safe
In my bed, my bed, my bed I never thought my memory
Of what we had could be intruded
But I couldn't let it be
I needed it as much as you did Now its not hard to understand
Why we just speak at night
The only time I hold your hand
Is to get the angle right
Everything is slowing down
River of no return
You recognize my every sound
There's nothing new to learn You'll never get my mind right
Like two ships passing in the night
In the night in the night
Want the same thing where we lay
Otherwise mine's a different way
A different way from where I'm going
Oh, its you again listen this isn't a reunion
So sorry if I turn my head
Yours is a familiar face
But that don't make your place safe
In my bed, my bed, my ba ba dee dee bed When you walk in the bar
And you dressed like a star
Rockin' your f me pumps
And the men notice you
With your Gucci bag crew
Can't tell who he's lookin' to 'Cause you all look the same
Everyone knows your name
And that's you whole claim to fame
Never miss a night
'Cause your dream in life
Is to be a footballer's wife You don't like players
That's what you say-a
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire
You don't like ballers
They don't do nothing for ya
But you'd love a rich man six foot two or taller You're more than a fan
Lookin' for a man
But you end up with one-night-stands
He could be your whole life
If you got past one night
But that part never goes right In the morning you're vexed
He's onto the next
And you didn't even get no taste
Don't be too upset
If they call you a skank
'Cause like the news everyday you get pressed You don't like players
That's what you say-a
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire
Or them big baller
Don't do nothing for ya
But you'd love a rich man six foot two or taller You can't sit down right
'Cause you jeans are too tight
And your lucky its ladies night
With your big empty purse
Every week it gets worse
At least your breasts cost more than hers So you did Miami
'Cause you got there for free
But somehow you missed the plane
You did too much E
Met somebody
And spent the night getting cane Without girls like you
There'd be no fun
We'd go to the club and not see anyone
Without girls like you
There's no nightlife
All those men just go home to their wives Don't be mad at me
'Cause you're pushing thirty
And your old tricks no longer work
You should have known from the jump
That you always get dumped
So dust off your fuck me pumps Brother
There's so much that I could never say to your face
Bye, bye now
You should know the world and all its ways so find your place How do I find words that do not condescend
When she bore you before me
'Cause she doesn't need a child, she needs a friend
A son not a sob story (Now you must have never heard of what she did for you)
And your priority, it must be heard
(Now you must have never heard of what she did for you)
'Cause we'll never be the way we were She can't always be there just to hold you down
Our mother
When you are at a age now well life turns around
My brother Realize that you don't have to answer to no man
Responsibility comes down to you
But how can I expect you to understand
When you live life like its so run through (Now you must have never heard of what she did for you)
Your priority, it must be heard
(Now you must have never heard of what she did for you)
'Cause we'll never be the way we were (Now you must have never heard of what she did for you)
And your priority, it must be heard
(Now you must have never heard of what she did for you)
'Cause we'll never be the way we were The way we were, we'll never be
And your priority, it must be heard Build your dreams to the stars above
But when you need someone to love
Don't go to strangers, darling, come to me Play with fire till your fingers burn
And when there's no place for you to turn
Don't go to strangers, darling, come to me For, when you hear a call to follow your heart
You'll follow your heart I know
I've been through it all, for I'm an old hand
And I'll understand if you go So
Make your mark for your friends to see
But when you need more than company
Don't go to strangers, darling, come to me Whoa, oh
Oh, whoa, oh He can only hold her for so long
The lights are on, but no one's home
She's so vacant
Her soul is taken
He thinks, What's she running from? Now, how can he have her heart
When it got stole?
So he tries to pacify her
'Cause what's inside her never dies Even if she's content in his warmth
She is plagued with urgency
Searching kisses
The man she misses
The man that he longs to be Now, how can he have her heart
When it got stole?
So he tries to pacify her
'Cause what's inside her never dies So he tries to pacify her
'Cause what's inside her it never dies So he tries to pacify her
But what's inside her never dies Lent you outsiders and my new Badu
While you were thinking I didn't have a clue
Tough to sort files with your voice in my head
So then I bribed you downstairs with a Marlboro Red, uh huh And now I feel so small discovering you knew
How much more torture would you have put me through?
You probably saw me laughing at all your jokes
Or how I did not mind when you stole all my smokes, yeah And although my pride is not easy to disturb, yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
With your battered jeans and your Beasties tee
Now I can't work like this, with you next to me And although he's nothing in the scheme of my years
It just serves to bludgeon my futile tears
And I'm not use to this, no no, I observe yeah, I don't chase
But now I'm stuck with consequences, thrust in my face, yeah
And the melodramas of my day delivery blows
And that surpass your rejection, it just goes to show
A simple attraction that reflects right back to me
So I'm not as into you as I appear to be Although my pride, yeah, is not easily disturbed
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
With your battered jeans, yeah and your Beasties tee, yeah yeah
Now I can't work like this, no with you next to me yeah yeah His message was brutal but the delivery was kind
Maybe if I get this down, I'll get it off my mind, yeah
Oh it serves to condition me and smoothen my kinks
Despite my frustration for the way that he thinks
And I knew the truth, when it came, would be to that effect
At least you're attracted to me which I did not expect
Didn't think you'd get my number down as such
But I never hated myself, for my age so much, yeah And although my pride's, yeah, not easy to disturbed, yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb, yeah
So with your battered jeans, yeah, and your Beasties tee
Now I can't work like this, no, with you next to me, yeah And although my pride's, yeah, not easy to disturbed, yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
So with your battered jeans yeah and your Beasties tee
Now I can't work like this, no, with you next to me To know know know him
Is to love love love him
Just to see that smile
Makes my life worthwhile To know know know him
Is to love love love him
And I do
And I do
And I do Oh I'll be good to him
I'll bring joy to him oh oh
Everyone says there'll come a day
When I'll walk alongside of him To know know know him
Is to love love love him

And I do Why can't he see?
How blind here he be?
Someday he'll see
That he was meant just for me, oh oh oh oh To know know know him
Is to love love love him
Just to see that smile
Makes my life worthwhile To know know know him
Is to love love love him
And I do
I really do
And I do I don't catch your drift and I don't catch your plan
Need to get my thoughts down but it's getting late
Need to get up now, get my feet on the ground
But the show is so unprepared now My place so messed up, I tried on some shoes
Should think clear and focus but I've things to do
Glancing at my CD rack, eyes linger on Frank
And I must put that check in the bank Try to put me in a room, distraction less
(Everything is everything)
Spare me from worse
In the studio I will finally burn
(All the time is all you got)
Tempted to work Always got something to do, someone to be seeing
Somewhere to be dancing, I'm a wake human being
It's an opportunity, shout till you go blue
Unless I wanna do it, your words go through Need to buy some cigarettes, can't put it off any longer
Worked appeal depression, I feel it growing stronger
Maybe when I'm all grown up, I will get it through
But right now I got stuff to do Try to put me in a room, distraction less
(Everything is everything)
Spare me from worse
In the studio I would finally burn
(All the time is all you got)
Tempted to work Put me in a room, distraction less
(Everything is everything)
Spare me from worse
In the studio I would finally burn
(All the time is all you got)
Tempted to work Gotta get this song down before I leave tonight
But my hair, just does it's own thing and I gotta look alright
And I gotta write a chorus but words allude me now
I have to get this down before I leave somehow And anyway I be thinkin' to meet you at the station
Guilty 'cause I should be home, damn procrastination
So when they ask me later, I won't tell them how it's going
But now my head is empty and the work load keeps on growing Try to put me in a room, distraction less
(Everything is everything)
Spare me from worse
In the studio, I would finally burn
(All the time is all you got)
Tempted to work Put me in a room, distraction less
Spare me from worse
In the studio I would finally burn
Tempted to work Distraction less
Spare me from worse
I would finally burn
Tempted to work When I walk in your shoes
I understand a man confused
There must have been but I don't care
I feel the way your soul does there Darling they empathize
Looking through your bloodshot eyes
And I know you you're so frustrated
Above we all become what we once hated
Be slight nobody can be that wise I can't help you if you won't help yourself
No I can't help you if you don't help yourself
You can only get so much from someone yeah
You can get so much from me
I can't help you if you won't help yourself You've got the degree in philosophy
So you think you're cleverer than me
('Cause you so smart)
But I'm not just some drama queen (Drama queen)
'Cause it's where you're at not where you've been
So what do you expect from me
(What do you want) To hold your head above the sea
(Keep you high and dry)
And carry you even though you're bigger
'Cause don't you know you crush my tiny figure And anyway we're still so young
(Yeah I'm so young)
And this isn't yet the day I can't help you if you won't help yourself
No I can't help you if you don't help yourself
(You won't help yourself)
You can only get so much from someone yeah
I can't help you if you won't help yourself You might be twenty-five but in my mind
I see you at sixteen years oh most of the time
And I'm, I'm just a child and you're full grown
And no I'm nothing like I've ever known yeah
You are like nothing that I ever knew I've been so many places in my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs I've made some bad rhyme
I've acted out my love in stages
With ten thousand people watching
But we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you I know your image of me is what I hope to be
I've treated you unkindly but darlin' can't you see
There's no one more important to me
Darlin' can't you please see through me
Cause we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you You taught me precious secrets of the truth withholding nothing
You came out in front and I was hiding
But now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody cause my love is in there hiding I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for in my life you are a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singing this song for you You taught me precious secrets of the truth withholding nothing
You came out in front and I was hiding
But now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody cause my love is in there hiding I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for in my life you are a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singing this song for you
We were alone and I was singing this song for you Understand once he was a family man
So surely I would never, ever go through it first hand
Emulate all the shit my mother hated
I can't help but demostrate my Freudian fate
My alibi for taking your guy
History repeats itself, it fails to die
And animal agression is my downfall
I don't care 'bout what you got I want it all It's bricked up in my head, it's shoved under my bed
And I question myself again: what is it 'bout men?
My destructive side has grown a mile wide
And I question myself again: what is it 'bout men? It's bricked up in my head, it's shoved under my bed
And I question myself again: what is it 'bout men?
My destructive side has grown a mile wide
And I question myself again: what is it 'bout men? Aye aye aye, aye aye aye
Tell you baby, you huggin' up the big monkey man
Aye aye aye, aye aye aye
Tell you baby, you huggin' up the big monkey man I never saw you, I only heard of you

Huggin' up the big monkey man
La la la la la la la
Huggin' up the big monkey man There is no greater love
Than what I feel for you
No sweeter song, no heart so true There is no greater thrill
Than what you bring to me
No sweeter song
Than what you sing, sing to me You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known
And to think that you are mine alone There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you If my man was fighting
Some unholy war
I would be behind him
Straight shook up beside him
With strength he didn't know
It's you I'm fighting for
He can't lose with me in tow
I refuse to let him go
At his side, and drunk on pride
We wait for the blow Put it in writing
But who you writing for?
Just us on kitchen floor
Justice done
Reciting, my stomach standing still
Like you're reading my will
He still stands in spite of what his scars say
I'll battle till this bitter finale
Just me, my dignity, and this guitar case, whoa, whoa If, if my man is fighting some unholy war
And I will stand beside you
But who you dying for?
B, I would have died too
I'd have liked to
If my man was fighting
Some unholy war
If my man was fighting I couldn't resist him
His eyes were like yours
His hair was exactly the shade of brown
He's just not as tall, but I couldn't tell
It was dark and I was lying down You are everything ' he means nothing to me
I can't even remember his name
Why're you so upset?
Baby, you weren't there and I was thinking of you when I came What do you expect?
You left me here alone; I drank so much and needed to touch
Don't overreact ' I pretended he was you
You wouldn't want me to be lonely How can I put it so you understand?
I didn't let him hold my hand
But he looked like you; I guess he looked like you
No he wasn't you
But you can still trust me, this ain't infidelity
It's not cheating; you were on my mind Yes he looked like you
But I heard love is blind Tonight you're mine, completely
You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
Will you love me tomorrow Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic of your sighs
Will you still love me tomorrow Tonight with words unspoken
You said that I'm the only one, the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning star I'd like to know that your love
Is a love I can be sure of
So tell me now, 'cause I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow I bought you a fur coat when you were fifteen
You wore it to the disco, where everyone was in jeans
But you were just a rich girl, and only having fun
Your worn out dresses, got stares from everyone
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong? You left for London, when you were nineteen
Had to pawn all your nice clothes, just living on dreams
A man in the bright lights took all that you own
Now he's taken your freedom for a date unknown But you were just a rich girl, hardly having fun
Your worn out dresses, brought stares from everyone
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong? Hey, little rich girl you've been away for so long
And now little rich girl, I wrote this song
Hey, little rich girl my love for you is gone
And now little rich girl, I know where you belong At your dad's office party all the movies were blue
You caused him so much heartache, because the screen star was you
You left for London, when you were nineteen
Had to pull off your nice clothes, but you were living on dreams You were a rich girl, and only having fun
But your worn out dresses, brought stares from everyone
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong?
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong? Your neighbors were screaming
I don't have a key for downstairs
So I punched all the buzzers hoping he would be there
And now my head's hurting
You say I always get my own way
But you were in the shower when I got there
And I don' wanted to stay, but I got nothing to say You were so beautiful before today
And then I heard what you say'man that was ugly The Moschino bra you bought me last Christmas
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Frank's in there and I don't care
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Just take it
Take the box Take the box I came home this evening and nothing felt like how it should be
I feel like writing you a letter but that is not me'you know me
Feel so fucking angry, don't want to be reminded of you
But when I left my shit in your kitchen
I said goodbye to your bedroom it smelled of you Mr False Pretence, you don't make sense
I just don't know you
But you make me cry, where's my kiss goodbye'
I think I love you The Moschino bra you bought me last Christmas
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Frank's in there and I don't care
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Now take it
Take the box
Just take it, take it
Take the box
And now just take the box
Take the box Oh, lullaby by birdland that's what i
Always hear, when you sigh,
Never in my wordland could there be words to reveal
In a phrase how i feel Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo, when they love?
That's the kind of magic music we made with our lips
When we kiss And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how i'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye Lullaby by birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet, and we'll go
Flying high in birdland, high in the sky up above
All because we're in love Lullaby, lullaby Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic music we made with our lips
When we kiss And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how i'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye Lullaby by birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet, and we'll go
Flying high in birdland, high in the sky up above
All because we're in love I should care, I should go around weeping
I should care, I should go without sleeping
Strangely enough, I sleep well
'cept for a dream or two
But then I count my sheep well
Funny how sheep can lull you to sleep So I should care, I should let it upset me
I should care but it just doesn't get me
Maybe I won't find someone as lovely as you
But I should care and I do (brief instrumental interlude) I should care but it just doesn't get me
Maybe I won't find someone as lovely as you
But I should care and I do And I do I would die before I divorce you
I'd take a thousand thumps for my love
'Cause you kiss a lucky horseshoe
Stuck it in my boxing glove
'Cause anyone who will see us
Through our victory and done defeat
Knows that I'll take you to the cleaners
If you come between the cheats Between the cheats, ooh oh oh ooh oh oh
Between the cheats, ooh oh oh ooh oh oh My husband is the finest handsome hustler
And he still make this housewife blush
So I'm holding my hand in his
I'm sitting on the royal flush
Women drink him in, swimming in his green eyes
Then go home and catch the chips you got
And take a bad beat to ooh to boat oh!
The jack of hearts is my jackpot Between the cheats, ooh oh oh ooh oh oh
Between the cheats, ooh oh oh ooh oh oh Catch me on, have to ?
And I know as my heart beats
There's a winning secret to both
And it's sworn between the cheats Between the cheats, ooh oh oh ooh oh oh
Between the cheats, ooh oh oh ooh oh oh
Between the cheats, ooh oh oh ooh oh oh Swing back and forth
A beautiful thing taking you away
My head is spinning My girl tried to stop me
But I had a taste of you
Unfamiliar surroundings
Left me wanting something new Physical ain't even my type
But you're one of a kind
So subconsciously on purpose
I left my coat behind I can't help it, need to stop it
All that I put myself through
Everyone is so denying
Yeah, it's nice to meet you, too I hate my alcoholic logic
As I write this on the train
Victoria's Secret in my bag
And my thighs ache again Last night tips into my mind
Through the puddle in my head
I always get what I want
I think I even said I can't help, it need to stop it
All that I put myself through
Everyone is so denying
Yeah, it's nice to meet you, too Although I enjoyed it
I should have tied up my loose ends
But I left my jacket with you
And you know my friends So maybe you will get my number
Or ask them when I'm ached down
But I may have forgotten you
By the next time I'm in town I can't help, it need to stop it
All that I put myself through
Everyone is so denying
Yeah, it's nice to meet you, too Well sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doing
And in my head I paint a picture 'Cause since I've come on home,
Well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over Valerie? Valerie
Valerie
Valerie Did you have to go to jail,
Put your house up for sale, did you get a good lawyer?
I hope you didn't catch a tan,
I hope you'll find the right man who'll fix it for ya
And are you shopping anywhere,
Changed the color of your hair, are you busy?
And did you have to pay that fine
You were dodging all the time, are you still dizzy? 'Cause since I've come on home,

Straight to my lovers heart, for me Yeah, Cupid.
Oh, Cupid.
Mm mm, Cupid. When you walk in the bar,
And you dressed like a star,
Rockin' your F me pumps. And the men notice you,
With your Gucci bag crew,
Can't tell who he's lookin' to. Cause you all look the same,
Everyone knows your name,
And that's you whole claim to fame. Never miss a night,
Cause your dream in life,
Is to be a footballers wife.
You don't like players,
That's what you say-a,
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire. You don't like ballers,
They don't do nothing for ya,
But you'd love a rich man six foot two or taller. You're more than a fan,
Lookin' for a man,
But you end up with one-nights-stands. He could be your whole life,
If you got past one night,
But that part never goes right. In the morning you're vexed,
He's onto the next,
And you didn't even get no taste. Don't be too upset,
If they call you a skank,
Cause like the news everyday you get pressed. You don't like players,
That's what you say-a,
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire. Or them big ballers,
Don't do nothing for ya.
But you'd love a rich man six foot two or taller, You can't sit down right,
Cause you jeans are too tight,
And your lucky its ladies night. With your big empty purse,
Every week it gets worse,
At least your breasts cost more than hers. So you did Miami,
Cause you got there for free,
But somehow you missed the plane. You did too much E,
Met somebody,
And spent the night getting caned. Without girls like you,
There'd be no fun,
We'd go to the club and not see anyone. Without girls like you,
There's no nightlife,
All those men just go home to their wives. Don't be mad at me,
Cause you're pushing thirty,
And your old tricks no longer work. You should have known from the job,
That you always get dumped,
So dust off your fuck me pumps You're wondering now, what to do, now you know this is the end
You're wondering how, you will pay, for the way you misbehaved First time I swallowed, now you're on your own
I won't return, forever you will wait You're wondering now, what to do, now you know this is the end First time I swallowed, now you're on your own
I won't return, forever you will wait You're wondering now, what to do, now you know this is the end
You're wondering how, you will pay, for the way you misbehaved You're wondering now, what to do, now you know this is the end
You're wondering how, you will pay, for the way you misbehaved
You're wondering now, what to do, now you know this is the end
You're wondering how, you will pay, for the way you misbehaved Simple sweet guitar
Humbled by the bass
So when the beat kicks in
Everything falls into place
And it overpowers me
I can't help but dance
You can try to stop me now
But you won't get the chance Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change
See it from a different view
Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change Rhythm floods my heart
The melody it feeds my soul
The tune tears me apart
And it swallows me whole
You should thank your lucky stars
'Cause the music is a gift
And it's stronger than all else
Provides me with uplift Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change
See it from a different view
Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change My lyrics revealing
Some natural vibe
Some kind of laid back feeling
Oh, just let it ride
And when Frank Sinatra sings
It's too much to take
So I sing the standard shit
It pacifies my ache Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change
See it from a different view
Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change Meet you downstairs in the bar and heard
Your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt
You say, "Why did you do it with him today?"
And sniff me out like I was Tanqueray 'Cause you're my fella, my guy
Hand me your Stella and fly
By the time I'm out the door
You tear me down like Roger Moore I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
You know that I'm no good Upstairs in bed with my ex-boy
He's in the place, but I can't get joy
Thinking of you in the final throes
This is when my buzzer goes Run out to meet your chips and pitter
You say when we're married 'cause you're not bitter
There'll be none of him no more
I cried for you on the kitchen floor I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
You know that I'm no good Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain
We're like how we were again
I'm in the tub, you're on the seat
Lick your lips as I soak my feet Then you notice little carpet burn
My stomach drops, and my guts churn
You shrug, and it's the worst
To truly stuck the knife in first I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
You know that I'm no good
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
Yeah, ya know that I'm no good Got back together with my man last night
But I think I was dreaming, he didn't feel quite right
I pressed his chest under my fingertips
Beside myself I sighed and reminded of his lips I'm confused and quizzical
Funny don'tcha know
I just wan get physical
Let me tell ya how Do me good, I'll tell you anything you want to hear
Do me good, do me good, do me good, do me good
Do me good and all this craziness will disappear
Do me good, do me good, do me good, do me good It's like he was designed with me in mind
He's so good from behind, he's beautifully defined
I miss him most of all when it got late
Attempt to hear him breathing or feel his shifting weight I'm confused and quizzical
Funny don'tcha know
I just wan get physical
Let me tell ya how Do me good, I'll tell you anything you want to hear
Do me good, do me good, do me good, do me good
Do me good and all this craziness will disappear
Do me good, do me good, do me good, do me good I never wanted you to be my man
I just wanted to see what you could do, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I feel it my heart like you were there
I never wanted you, many times when I tried to set you right, it's just too hard
I never wanted you to be my man but I really couldn't control myself I can't wait to get away from you
And surprisingly you hate me too
We only communicate when we need to fight
But we are best friends...right? You're too good at pretending you don't care
There's enough resentment in the air
Now you don't want me in the flat
When you're home at night
But we're best friends right? You're Stephanie and I'm Paulette
You know what all my faces mean
And it's easy to smoke it up, forget
Everything that happened in between Nicky's right when he says I can't win
So I don't wanna tell you anything
I can't even think about
How you feel inside
But we are best friends, right? I don't like the way you say my name
You're always looking for someone to blame
Now you want me to suffer just cause
You was born wide
But we are best friends right? You're Stephanie and I'm Paulette
You know what all my faces mean
And its easy to smoke it up, forget
Everything that happened in between So I had love for you when I was 4
And there's no one I wanna smoke with more
Someday I'll buy the Rizla, so you get the dro
Cause we are best friends right, right, right, right?
Because we are best friends right?
Because we are best friends right? My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul
I spend my days in longin'
And wondering why it's me you're (ogling) I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul
I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
And less I could have one more chance to prove, dear My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul
My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I would gladly surrender myself to you body and soul Attracts me, till it hurts to concentrate,
Distract me, stop me doin work I hate
Just to show him how it feels;
I walk past his desk in heels
One leg resting on the chair
From the side he pulls my hair. Amy Amy Amy
Although I've been here before
Amy Amy Amy
Your just to hard to ignore
Masculin you spin a spell
I think you'd wear me well
Amy Amy Amy
Wheres my morel parallel It takes me, half an hour to write a verse
He makes me imagine it from bad to worse
My weakness from the other sex
Every time his shoulders flex
The way the shirt hangs off his back
My train of thought spins right off track Amy Amy Amy
Although I've been here before Amy Amy Amy
He's just to hard to ignore
Masculine he spins a spell
I think he'd wear me well
Amy Amy Amy
Wheres my morel parallel His own style, right down to his diesel jeans
Imobile, I can't think by any means
Underwhere peeks at the top
I'll let you know where you should stop
From the picture my mind drew
I know I'd look good on you Amy Amy Amy
Although I've been here before
Amy Amy Amy
Your just to hard to ignore
Masculine you spin a spell
I think you'd wear me well
Amy Amy Amy
Wheres my morel parallel Creative energy abused
All my lyrics go unused
When I clock black hair blue eyes
I drift off I fantasize Amy Amy Amy
Although I've been here before
Amy Amy Amy
He's just to hard to ignore
Masculine he spins a spell
I think he'd wear me well
Amy Amy Amy
Wheres my morel parallel
Amy Amy Amy
Although I've been here before
Amy Amy Amy
He's just to hard to ignore
Masculine he spins a spell
I think he'd wear me well
Amy Amy Amy
Wheres my morel parallel Nobody stands in between me and my man it's me and Mr Jones
What kind of fuckery is this? You made me Mr Slick Ricky
I thought I didn't love you when I did
I can't believe you played me out like that No you ain't worth guest lists plus one of all them girls you kissed
You can't keep lying to yourself like this
I can't believe you played yourself like this Who loves one thing but come Brixton
Nobody stands in between me and my man
'Cause it's me and Mr Jones
What kind of fuckery are we? Nowadays you don't mean dick to me
I might let you make it up to me, who's playing Saturday What kind of fuckery are you? Besides from some of you being my best black Joe
But I could swear that we were through
I still wonder about the things you do Mr Destiny lying infinitely, nobody stands in between me and my man
'Cause it's me and Mr Jones I can see you ahead of me
But I'm not always forward thinkin'
I tell you what you want to hear
It depends on what I've been drinkin' Cause everything I do or say
Makes it hard for you to stay
We both know what it is Now-a-days we talk too much
Like your forgetting all the good shit
You decide what's wrong with me
I always used to let you say But now I like to think out loud
Your runnin' with some different crowd
We both know what it is I don't know you anymore
Supposed to be the man
That I live my life by
And your attitude become a bore
And I'm so tired I cant even cry Mr Ultra sensitive
I'll never let myself forget you
Messed each other up you know
So I'm sorry if I upset you Tomorrow is another day
So I'll call you cause that's OK We both know what it is I don't know you anymore
Supposed to be the man
That I live my life by
And you're attitude become a bore
And I'm so tired
I can't even cry Relationship doesn't remain
We resonate on different flames
I could cut you down again
If you were like all other men
If you were like all other men
I know that I could shut you down again
But my friend, but my friend I don't know you anymore
Supposed to be the man
That I live my life by
And your attitude become a bore
And I'm so tired I cant even cry I don't know you anymore
Supposed to be the man
That I live my life by
And your attitude become a bore
And I'm so tired I can't even cry All I can ever be to you,
Is a darkness that we knew,
And this regret I had to get accustomed to,
Once it was so right,
When we were at our high,
Waiting for you in the hotel at night,
I knew I hadn't met my match,
But every moment we could snatch,
I don't know why I got so attached,
It's my responsibility,
And you don't owe nothing to me,
But to walk away I have no capacity He walks away,
The sun goes down,
He takes the day but I'm grown,
And in this grey, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own, I don't understand,
Why do I stress a man,
When there's so many better things at hand,
We could a never had it all,
We had to hit a wall,
So this is inevitable withdrawal,
Even if I stop wanting you,
A perspective pushes through,
I'll be some next man's other woman soon, I shouldn't play myself again,
I should just be my own best friend,
Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men, He walks away,
The sun goes down,
He takes the day but I'm grown,
And it's okay,
In this blue shade,
My tears dry on their own, So we are history,
Your shadow covers me
The sky above,
A blaze He walks away,
The sun goes down,
He takes the day but I'm grown,
And it's okay,
In this blue shade
My tears dry on their own, I wish I could say no regrets,
And no emotional debts,
And as we kiss goodbye the sun sets,
So we are history,
The shadow covers me,
The sky above a blaze that only lovers see, He walks away,
The sun goes down,
He takes the day but I'm grown,
And it's okay,
In this blue shade,
My tears dry on their own, He walks away,
The sun goes down,
He takes the day but I'm grown,
And it's okay,
My deep shade,
My tears dry on their own He walks away,
The sun goes down,
He takes the day but I'm grown,
And it's okay,
My deep shade,
My tears dry She sits home and dreams
That her man will leave his mark on her hand
He's not all he seems
But she's seen a dress, she has the flowers planned
Now she won't be happy
Till she look down and sees the engagement ring
It's for security
But she will be waiting years for her wedding [Chorus]
For me it ain't real
It's fools gold
There too many fools sold
Not an excuse oh
For me it ain't real
It's fools gold
I don't hear everything I'm told He won't change her life
He just chasing tail
And wasting her time
She calls herself his wife
He calls her at 8 says be here by 9
She don't notice how when she gets the ring
It's not a good fit
So next time that they row She throws it out
It goes to the last girl he hit [Chorus] So take the gold you find
And for your own sake
Hold it in your hand
Now make sure you bite down
And watch your tooth don't break on that wedding band For me it ain't real
It's fools gold
There too many fools sold
Not an excuse oh
For me it ain't real
Yes it's fools gold Every day I see you
My hands were made for you
And you always give me stress free point of view
Pick you up after school Mister Magic, take a token
Mister Magic, of my love
Mister Magic, I see you through the smoke Without you I'm misery
Blue without my green
All the songs sound better when you're next to me
Yeah, 'cause you come naturally Mister Magic, take a token
Mister Magic, of my love, love, love (Mister Magic)
I see you through the smoke Laying on my bed
I reach over for you
And you so fresh you even make the standards new
Burn the tip to get you through Mister Magic, take a token
Mister Magic, of my love
Mister Magic, I see you through the smoke Mister Magic
Mister Magic
Mister Magic, waiting for the smoke to clear
I'm waiting for the smoke to clear It's always gone within two days.
Follow my father, his extravagant ways.
So if I got it I will spend it all,
Camden and Parkway 'til I hit a wall. I cross my fingers at the cash machine,
As I check my balance I kiss the screen.
I love it when it says I got the means,
To go to Miss Sixty and pick up my new jeans. Chorus: (x2)
Never lasts me long,
Handle finance wrong,
Blow it all on bags and shoes,
Jazz 'n blues. Standin' too deep at the bar today,
Wait with impatience to throw my cash away.
Four white Russians a JD and Coke, Buy their drinks all night and now I am broke.
But that's cool 'cause I can borrow more from you,
And I didn't forget about that fifty pound, too.
Tell you what, my advance is comin' through,
I'll take you out shoppin',
Can you wait 'til next June? Yeah. Chorus:
Never lasts me long,
Handle finance wrong (handle it wrong),
Blow it all on bags and shoes,
Jazz 'n blues (jazz and blues).
Never lasts me long (long),
Handle finance wrong (wrong),
Blow it all on bags and shoes (blow it all),
Jazz 'n blues. Tall and tanned and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes
Each man she passes
Goes Aaah! When she moves it's like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gently
That when she passes
Each man she passes
Goes Aaah! Oh but he watches so sadly
How can he tell her he loves her
He would just give his heart gladly But each day when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead not at he Tall and tanned and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes
He smiles
But she doesn't see
No she doesn't see
She just doesn't see Runnin' down my batt - er- ies
Layin' me out to rest
Knowin' when that is
Five hours
I wake up and de-stress
And I'm diggin' myself into a hole
And these days I just work
I will when I have so much sun CHORUS:
And lately I've forgotten who I am
Late - ely my energy's just drained away
And now..my mind..is workin' overtime
It's been a loooong day
Such a long day, ...ay, ay mmm
and while all my contempt
For every...(all my friends say)
I should take in college now
My education is dragging, dragging
innit
My guitar to London town
And the thing that wakes me
when I could sleep instead
Is the thought that to deny?
That I could fall back into bed Chorus:
And lately, I 've forgotten who I am
Late - ely, my energy's just drained away
And now...my mind....is workin' overtime
It's been a looooooooooooooong day
It's been a long day Recently my head
It ain't recharged as such
And sleep can only cure, yeah
A restless mind so much Chorus:
Lately I've forgotten who I am
Sleep too late
My energy's just drained away
And now my mind is workin' overtime
It's been a long day
It's been a long long long day
It's been a long long long day
It's been a long day
So long, so long, so loooooooooong Mmm yeah
Oooooh, yeah [Chorus x2:]
B boy, be my baby (won't you be my baby)
My one and only baby (be my baby now)
B boy, be my baby (be my baby now)
My one and only baby (Oh, oh, oh, oh) It was winnin' time, you know what they say
Did you think about us, did you miss your baby?
I'ma catch the train, guess I'm headin' your way
You're my number one, that's all, a newborn son
Won't you be my king? (won't you be my king?) 'Cause I know you care, I'll dirty dance for you
And when I'm done I'm gonna do it again
And when it's over I'ma pull you closer
Keep your Nikes on, you know how we do
There's nothing he won't try
We're like two stars in the sky You are my rainy day, sunshine
It's plain to see
My heat in the cold of Winter
Just so right for me
So won't you please [Chorus] Put two in the air if you feel like me
Someone who cares feels so freaky
In demand by all the ladies
He's not for sale, he's being home-delivered to me
So hang up for your trying cards, please (he's my baby) Love-sick calls, that's what I get
I hear his voice and things get wet
Knows what I want, then he'll fetch
He's my boo and I'm his little pet, his little pet
You never know what he'll do next, he's my baby My rainy days, my sunshine
Living fantasy
My heat in the cold of Winter
Just so right for me
So won't you please [Chorus x2] Make a name for myself in different ways
All the while you will see my songs of praise
How can I concentrate when all the while my head
Throw me scenarios so I tease my self esteem
Though I can talk it through
Really I finally talk
My frustration is released but nothing let em know
And added to that Im sick of having to seek some peace
Because I need emotion with my physical release Cant help
But bring it up and beat the point to death
But my
Words are for nothing, Im wasting my breath
Cant help
But bring it up and beat the point to death
But my words are for nothing, I just keep wasting my breath Now everywhere I got and I always stare
I justify attraction by your hands, your lips, your hair
And so although I always look I know that I cant touch
And because I can only take a full time man so much
And now I reached a point where I dont care anymore
Its a necessity just like it was before
Many says I ignore the way my body aches
Cause Im the shit I earn I cant look for my sins
Oh, oh, no Cant help
But bring it up and beat the point to death
But my
Words are for nothing, Im wasting my breath
Cant help
But bring it up and beat the point to death
But my words are for nothing, I just keep wasting my breath Cant help
I cant help but bring it up, no
But my
Nothing, no
Cant
I cant help, no, no
But my words are for nothing, I just keep wasting my breath Cant help
But bring it up and beat the point to death
But my
Words are for nothing, Im wasting my breath
Cant help
But bring it up and beat the point to death
But my words are for nothing, I just keep wasting my breath Cant help
But my
Cant help
But my words are for nothing, I just keep wasting my breath You're just a little boy underneath that hat
You need your nerve to hide your ego, don't come with that
You think everything is handed to you free
But it's not that easy, no I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta know you now and then My girl says I'm too sensitive to ride with you
But I'm not listening to her, mm hm
Yes I'm perceptive so when I've dance with you
You'll whisk your head back the way it were
As you were I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta know you now and then Oh, I'm not ruling you out
I'm just in doubt as to what you say you're all about, yeah I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta show you now and them
I gotta know you now and then I gotta know you now
We may never meet again I gotta know you now
We may never meet again I gotta know you now
We may never meet again I gotta know you now
We may never meet again You should be stronger than me
You been here 7 years longer than me
Don't you know you supposed to be the man,
Not pal in comparison to who you think I am, You always wanna talk it through - I don't care!
I always have to comfort you when I'm there
But that's what I need you to do - stroke my hair! 'cause' I've forgotten all of young love's joy,
Feel like a lady, but you my lady boy, You should be stronger than me,
But instead you're longer than frozen turkey,
Why'd you always put me in control?
All I need is for my man to live up to his role,
Always wanna talk it through- I'm ok,
Always have to comfort you every day,
But that's what I need you to do - are you gay? I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, but you my lady boy He said 'the respect I made you earn -
Thought you had so many lessons to learn'
I said 'You don't know what love is - get a grip!' -
Sounds as if you're reading from some other tired script I'm not gonna meet your mother anytime
I just wanna rip your body over mine
So tell me why you think that's a crime I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, but you my lady boy Today my bird flew away
Gone to find her big blue jay
Starlight before she took flight
I sung a lullaby of bird land every night
Sung for my Ava every night Ava was the morning, now she's gone
She's reborn like Sarah Vaughan
In the sanctuary she has found
Birds surround her sweet sound
And Ava flies in paradise With dread I woke in my bed
To shooting pains up in my head
Lovebird, my beautiful bird
Spoken 'til one day she couldn't be heard
She just stopped singing Ava was the morning, now she's gone
She's reborn like Sarah Vaughan
In the sanctuary she has found
Birds surround her sweet sound
And Ava flies in paradise It begins to tell 'round midnight
'Round midnight
I do pretty well 'til after sundown
Suppertime I'm feeling sad
But it really gets bad 'round midnight Memories always start 'round midnight
'Round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And old midnight knows it too When some quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending
Darling I need you
Lately I find
You're out of my arms
And I'm out of my mind Let our love take wing some midnight
'Round midnight
Let the angels sing
For your returning
Let our love be safe and sound
When old midnight comes around Let our love take wing some midnight
'Round midnight
Let the angels sing
For your returning
Let our love be safe and sound
When old midnight comes around He can only hold her for so long, the lights are on but no one's home
She's so vacant, her soul is taken
He thinks 'What's she running from?
Now, how can he have a heart? When it got stole
So he tries to pacify her, for what's inside her never dies Even if she's contenting his wants, she is played with urgency
Searches the man she misses, the man that he longs to be
Now, how can he have her heart? When it got stole
So he tries to pacify her, 'cause what's inside her never dies So he tries to pacify her, 'cause of what's inside her it never dies
So he tries to pacify her, for what's inside her never dies Meet you downstairs in the bar and heard
Your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt
You say, "What did you do with him today?"
And sniff me out like I was Tanqueray 'Cause you're my fella, my guy
Hand me your Stella and fly
By the time I'm out the door
You tear me down like Roger Moore I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
You know that I'm no good Upstairs in bed with my ex-boy
He's in the place, but I can't get joy
Thinking of you in the final throes
This is when my buzzer goes Run out to meet your chips and pitter
You say when we're married 'cause you're not bitter
There'll be none of him no more
I cried for you on the kitchen floor I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
You know that I'm no good Ayo, I knew you was trouble when I first laid eyes on you
Temperature's so hot, the heat just rise with you
Let me ride with you, talk about your mistakes
You cheated yourself but these are the breaks
And it never be the same again, cause of old boy
But oh boy, together we make so much joy
In the sands and oh, what a wet, wee-wee
But you played me, so I had to roll up my sleeves and
Hunt you down, holding the next man's stacks
Now you sorry, tryin' bring that old thing back and
Act like we can rekindle that flame
It's a shame, how you can't get me off the brain
He that lame, you love how I bring the pain
Got the rug burns stinging and you saying my name
Say my name, that's right, I'm high post
Get the champagne, love, word up, we gon' toast I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
Yet you know that I'm no good Attracts me, till it hurts to concentrate,
Distract me, stop me doin work I hate
Just to show him how it feels;
I walk past his desk in heels
One leg resting on the chair
From the side he pulls my hair. Amy Amy Amy
Although I've been here before
Amy Amy Amy
Your just to hard to ignore
Masculin you spin a spell
I think you'd wear me well
Amy Amy Amy
Wheres my morel parallel It takes me, half an hour to write a verse
He makes me imagine it from bad to worse
My weakness from the other sex
Every time his shoulders flex
The way the shirt hangs off his back
My train of thought spins right off track Amy Amy Amy
Although I've been here before Amy Amy Amy
He's just to hard to ignore
Masculine he spins a spell
I think he'd wear me well
Amy Amy Amy
Wheres my morel parallel His own style, right down to his diesel jeans
Imobile, I can't think by any means
Underwhere peeks at the top
I'll let you know where you should stop
From the picture my mind drew
I know I'd look good on you Amy Amy Amy
Although I've been here before
Amy Amy Amy
Your just to hard to ignore
Masculine you spin a spell
I think you'd wear me well
Amy Amy Amy
Wheres my morel parallel Creative energy abused
All my lyrics go unused
When I clock black hair blue eyes
I drift off I fantasize Amy Amy Amy
Although I've been here before
Amy Amy Amy
He's just to hard to ignore
Masculine he spins a spell
I think he'd wear me well
Amy Amy Amy
Wheres my morel parallel

Although I've been here before
Amy Amy Amy
He's just to hard to ignore
Masculine he spins a spell
I think he'd wear me well
Amy Amy Amy
Wheres my morel parallel I can't wait to get away from you
Unsurprisingly you hate me too
We only communicate when we need to fight
But we are best friends right? You're too good at pretending you don't care
There's enough resentment in the air
Now you don't want me in the flat
When you?re home at night
But we're best friends right? You're Stephanie and I'm Paulette
You know what all my faces mean
And it's easy to smoke it up, forget
Everything that happened in between Nicky's right when he says I can't win
So I don't wanna tell you anything
I can't even think about
How you feel inside
But we are best friends, right? I don't like the way you say my name
You're always looking for someone to blame
Now you want me to suffer just cause
You was born wide
But we are best friends right? You're Stephanie and I'm Paulette
You know what all my faces mean
And its easy to smoke it up, forget
Everything that happened in between So I had love for you when I was 4
And there's no one I wanna smoke with more
Someday I'll buy the Rizla, so you get the dro
'Cause we are best friends right, right, right, right?
Because we are best friends right?
Because we are best friends right? It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to
Cry if I want to
You would cry too if it's happened to you
Nobody knows where my johnny has gone
But Judy left the same time
Why was he holding her hand
When he's supposed to be mine Play all my records keep dancing all night
But leave me alone for a while
'Till johnny's dancing with me
I've got no reason to smile Judy and johnny just walked through that door
Like a queen with her king
Oh what a birthday surprise
Judy's wearing his ring Lent you outsiders and my new Badu
While you were thinking I didn't have a clue
Tough to sort files with your voice in my head
So then I bribed you downstairs with a Marlboro red And now I feel so small discovering you knew
How much more torture would you have put me through?
You probably saw me laughing at all your jokes
Or how I did not mind when you stole all my smokes yeah And although my pride is not easy to disturb yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
With your battered jeans and your Beastie tee
Now I can't work like this, with you next to me And although he's nothing in the scheme of my years
It just serves to bludgeon my futile tears
And I'm not use to this,no no, I observe, I don't chase
So now I'm stuck with consequences, thrust in my face
And the melodramas of my day delivery blows
And that surpass your rejection it just goes to show
A simple attraction that reflects right back to me
So I'm not as into you as I appear to be And although my pride's not easily disturbed
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
With your battered jeans and your Beastie tee yeah yeah
Now I can't work like this with you next to me yeah yeah His message was brutal but the delivery was kind
Maybe if I get this down I'll get it off my mind
It serves to condition me and smoothen my kinks
Despite my frustration for the way that he thinks
And I knew the truth, when it came, would be to that effect
At least you're attracted to me which I did not expect
Didn't think you get my number down as such
But I never hated myself for my age so much yeah And although my pride's, yeah, not easily disturbed, yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
So with your battered jeans yeah and your Beastie tee
Now I can't work like this, no, with you next to me And although my pride's, yeah, not easily disturbed, yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
So with your battered jeans yeah and your Beastie tee
Now I can't work like this, no, with you next to me Ooh....... New York x2 Grew up in a town that is famous as a place of movie scenes
Noise is always loud, there are sirens all around and the streets are mean
If I can make it here, I can make it anywhere, that's what they say
Seeing my face in lights or my name on marquees found down on Broadway Even if it ain't all it seems, I got a pocket full of dreams
Baby, I'm from New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it from New York, New York, New York! On the avenue, there ain't never a curfew, ladies work so hard

Noise is always loud

I could make it anywhere
That's what they say
Seeing my face in lights
Or my name in marquees found down Broadway Even if it ain't all it seems
I got a pocketful of dreams
Baby, I'm from [Chorus]
New York, concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York, New York, New York On the avenue, there ain't never a curfew
Ladies work so hard
Such a melting pot on the corner selling rock
Preachers pray to God
Hail a gypsy cab
Takes me down from Harlem to the Brooklyn Bridge
Someone sleeps tonight with a hunger
For more than from an empty fridge I'm going to make it by any means
I got a pocketful of dreams
Baby, I'm from [Chorus: x2] One hand in the air for the big city
Street lights, big dreams, all looking pretty
No place in the world that can compared
Put your lighters in the air
Everybody say yeah, yeah yeah [Chorus] Moment of honesty
Someones gotta take the lead tonight
Who's it gonna be?
I'm gonna sit right here
And tell you all that comes to me
If you have something to say
You should say it right now You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it
Its becoming something that's impossible to ignore
And I can't take it
I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable would it make us look crazy
If you ask me I'm ready
If you ask me I'm ready I know you said to me
"This is exactly how it should feel when its meant to be"
Time is only wasting so why wait for eventually
If we gonna do something 'bout it
We should do it right now
(We should do it right now) You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I know I deserve it
Its becoming something that's impossible to ignore
It is what we make it
I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable would it make us look crazy
Or would it be so beautiful either way I'm sayin'
If you ask me I'm ready
If you ask me I'm ready Why give up before we try
Feel the lows before the highs
Clip our wings before we fly away (fly away)
I can't say I came prepared
I'm suspended in the air
Won't you come be in the sky with me I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable would it make us look crazy
Or would it be so beautiful either way I'm sayin'
If you ask me I'm ready
If you ask me I'm ready
If you ask me I'm ready
If you ask me I'm ready I keep on fallin'
In and out of love
With you
Sometimes I love ya
Sometimes you make me blue
Sometimes I feel good
At times I feel used
Lovin' you darlin'
Makes me so confused I keep on fallin'
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I love you Oh, oh, I never felt this way
How do you give me so much pleasure
And cause me so much pain
Just when I think
I've taken more than would a fool
I start fallin' back in love with you I keep on fallin'
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I love you Oh, baby
I, I, I, I'm fallin'
I, I, I, I'm fallin'
Fall I keep on fallin'
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I love you I'm fallin'
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I love you I'm fallin'
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I love you What? Even if you were a million miles away
I can still feel you in my bed
Near me, touch me, feel me And even at the bottom of the sea
I could still hear inside my head
Telling me, touch me, feel me
And all the time, you were telling me lies So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you Have you ever try sleeping with a broken heart?
Well you could try sleeping in my bed
Lonely, own me, nobody ever shut it down like you You wore the crown, you made my body feel heaven bound
Why don't you hold me, need me
I thought you told me, you'd never leave me Looking in the sky I could see your face
Then I knew right where I fit in
Take me, make me, you know that I'll always be in love with you
Right till the end So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you Anybody could've told you right from the start it's 'bout to fall apart
So rather than hold on to a broken dream I'll just hold on to love
And I could find a way to make it, don't hold on too tight
I'll make it without you tonight So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power, yeah
Some people live just to play the game Some people think that the physical things define what's within
And I've been there before, and that life's a bore
So full of the superficial Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, yeah Some people search for a fountain
That promises forever young
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way to prove you love them Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be
With no one to share, with no one who truly cares for me Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, yeah If I ain't got you with me baby
So nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing
If I ain't got you with me baby Everywhere I'm turning
Nothing seems complete
I stand up and I'm searching
For the better part of me
I hang my head from sorrow
State of humanity
I wear it on my shoulders
Gotta find the strength in me I am a Superwoman
Yes I am
Yes she is
Even when I'm a mess
I still put on a vest
With an S on my chest
Oh yes
I'm a Superwoman For all the mothers fighting
For better days to come
And all my women, all my women sitting here trying
To come home before the sun
And all my sisters
Coming together
Say yes I will
Yes I can I am a Superwoman
Yes I am
Yes she is
Even when I'm a mess
I still put on a vest
With an S on my chest
Oh yes
I'm a Superwoman When I'm breaking down
And I can't be found
And I start to get weak
Cause no one knows
Me underneath these clothes
But I can fly
We can fly, ooh I am a Superwoman
Yes I am
Yes she is
Even when I'm a mess
I still put on a vest
With an S on my chest
Oh yes
I'm a Superwoman Oh ooh Baby, baby, baby

Really, really wanted to catch your eye
Somethin' special 'bout you

Rah, rah, rah, rah I remember those days when we was dead broke an
I could barely find a dolla for a token
Hop in the train to just get where I'm going
Hobos after me, runnin' like I'm smokin'
Remember those days when I went to bed hungry
All I ever ate was white rice and honey
Big dreams in my head empty my tummy
Might crack a smile but ain't nothin' funny I remember playin' over needles in the streets
Everywhere I go a man want some part of me
Dirty Dirty hookas and hoes on 11th avenue
Sellin' bodies for doh
Remember cryin' sayin' that will never be me
Gonna make it someday gonna be somebody
Say mommy donÃ¢??t worry cause its just u and me
One day we will get out of this misery (hey!) We get di ting dem, dem outta luck now

Yesterday Mikey call me pan mi phone
Me say Mikey It's been a while, I'm not who I was before
You look surprised, your words don't burn me anymore
Been meaning to tell you, but I guess it's clear to see
Don't be mad, it's just the brand new kind of me
Can't be bad, I found a brand new kind of free Careful with your ego, he's the one that we should blame
Had to grab my heart back
God know something had to change
I thought that you'd be happy
I found the one thing I need, why you mad
It's just the brand new kind of me It took a long long time to get here
It took a brave, brave girl to try
It took one too many excuses, one too many lies
Don't be surprised, don't be surprised if i talk a little louder
If I speak up when you're wrong
If I walk a little taller
I'd be known to you too long
If you noticed that I'm different
Don't take it personally
Don't be mad, it's just the brand new kind of me
And it ain't bad, I found a brand new kind of free Oh, it took a long long road to get here
It took a brave brave girl to try
I've taken one too many excuses, one too many lies
Don't be surprised, oh see you look surprised Hey, if you were a friend, you want to get know me again
If you were worth a while
You'd be happy to see me smile
I'm not expecting sorry
I'm too busy finding myself
I got this
I found me, I found me, yeah I don't need your opinion
I'm not waiting for your okay
I'll never be perfect, but at least now I'm brave
Now, my heart is open
And I can finally breathe
Don't be mad, it's just the brand new kind of free
That ain't bad, I found a brand new kind of me
Don't be mad, it's just a brand new time for me We're at the crossroads, my dear
Where do we go from here?
Maybe you won't go, maybe you'll stay
Oh I know I'm gonna miss you either ways
It's such a lonely road [Chorus: x2]
Where do we go from here?
All I can do is, follow the tracks of my tears
Oh
When I cry your name
Am I crawling in bed
Oh and am I waiting only to drown in pain
Oh
Don't you do it
No, said don't you leave me this way
I don't know
If I can lift my head and face another day
Ooh it's such a lonely road Where do we go from here?
All I can do is, follow the tracks of my tears
You seem now the kind of girl who's lost and looking for direction
(Who could this be? Staring at me)
When I'm looking in the mirror trying to find a resolution
(Me too far gone, to find my way home) [Chorus] Where do we go from here?
All I can do is, follow the tracks of my tears If I had no more time
No more time left to be here
Would you cherish what we had'
Was it everything that you were looking for?
If I couldn't feel your touch
And no longer were you with me
I'd be wishing you were here
To be everything that I'd be looking for
I don't wanna forget the present is a gift
And I don't wanna take for granted the time you may have here with me
'Cause lord only knows another day is not really guaranteed So every time you hold me
Hold me like this is the last time
Every time you kiss me
Kiss me like you'll never see me again
Every time you touch me
Touch me like this is the last time
Promise that you'll love me
Love me like you'll never see me again Oh oh oh How many really know what love is'
Millions never will
Do you know until you lose it That it's everything that we are looking for
When I wake up in the morning
You're beside me
I'm so thankful that I found
Everything that I been looking for I don't wanna forget the present is a gift
And I don't wanna take for granted the time you may have here with me
'Cause lord only knows another day is not really guaranteed So every time you hold me
Hold me like this is the last time
Every time you kiss me
Kiss me like you'll never see me again
(Can you do that for me baby)
Every time you touch me
(See we don't really know)
Touch me like this is the last time
(See everyday we never know)
Promise that you'll love me
(I want you to promise me)
Love me like you'll never see me again
(Like you'll never see me again) Oh oh oh oh oh This song is dedicated
To all the lovers who cant be together
Separated by distance and time You were always on my mind
All I do is count the days
Where are you now? Know I never let you down
I will never go away I really wish that you would stay but what would we do
All the days that you've been gone I dream about you
And I anticipate the day that you will come home, home, home No matter how far you are
No matter how long it takes him
Through distance and time
I'll be waiting And if you have to walk a million miles
I'll wait a million days to see you smile
Distance and time, I'll be waiting Distance and time, I'll be waiting
Will you take a train, to meet me where I am
Are you on your way?
And I will never do anything to hurt you
I'll never live without you I really wish that you would stay but what would we do
All the days that you've been gone I dreamed about you
And I anticipate the day that you will come home, home, home No matter how far you are
No matter how long it takes him
Distance and time, I'll be waiting
And if you have to walk a million miles
I'll wait a million days to see you smile
Distance and time
I'll be waiting No matter how far you are
No matter how long it takes him
Through distance and time, I'll be waiting
And you can walk a million miles
I'll wait a million days to see you smile
Through distance and time, I'll be waiting Oh oh oh, oh
Oh oh oh, hey
Oh oh oh oh I'll be waiting
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Through distance and time
I'll be waiting You are always on my mind
All I do is count the days
Where are you now? JW: Another ringer with the slick trigger finger for Her Majesty
AK: One with the golden gun poison in your fantasy
JW: Another bill from a killer turned a thrill into a tragedy CHORUS:
A door left open
A woman walking by
A drop in the water
A look in the eye
A phone on the table
A man on your side
Someone that you think that you can trust is just
Another way to die JW: Another tricky little gun giving solace to the one that will never see the sunshine
AK: Another inch of your life sacrificed for your brother in the nick of time
JW: Another dirty money, heaven sent honey turning on a dime [CHORUS] Its just another way to Hey Its just another way to Youve got to. JW: Another girl with her finger on the world singing do what you wanna hear
AK: Another gun thrown down and surrendered took away your fear
JW & AK: Another man that stands right behind you looking in the mirror [CHORUS] Its just another way Suit em up, bang bang! Bang, bang, bang, bang. Said I'd be gone by five
But it's sun rise and I'm still in your bed
Goodnight usually means goodbye
Me re-playing memories in my head
Look at you, look at you
Look what you made me do
How do you, how do you think know my every move
Who are you Who are you You look so familiar
I know you, I know you, baby, I know the truth We got way too much in common
If I'm being honest with you
We got way too much in common
Since I'm being honest with you Who wants to love somebody like me?
You wanna love somebody like me?
If you could love somebody like me
You must be messed up too
Who wants to love somebody like me?
You wanna love somebody like me?
If you could love somebody like me
You must be messed up too We used to talk 'til midnight
All those days that you stayed at my house
We were just passing the time
When we were young and we ain't had no vows
Now, now, now maybe later on, I'll text you and maybe you'll reply
We both know we had no patience together day and night
Getting high on our supply, yeah, we ain't satisfied
I could love you all occasions We got way too much in common
If I'm being honest with you
We got way too much in common
Since I'm being honest with you Who wants to love somebody like me?
You wanna love somebody like me?
If you could love somebody like me
You must be messed up too
Who wants to love somebody like me?
You wanna love somebody like me?
If you could love somebody like me

Driving in a fast car
Trying to get somewhere
Don't know where I'm going
But I gotta get there
A veces me siento perdido
Inquieto, solo y confundido
Entonces me ato a las estrellas Y al mundo entero le doy vueltas
I'm singing for somebody like you
Sorta like me baby
Yo canto para alguien como tú
Pon la oreja, nena
Oh oh oh oh
Estoy buscando ese momento
La música, que cuando llega
Me llena con su sentimiento Con sentimiento, vida llena
Walking down the sideway
Looking for innocence
Trying to find my way
Trying to make some sense
Yo canto para alguien como tú
Sólo como tú, baby
I'm singing for somebody like you

Sólo como tú, oh, my sister
Todo el mundo va buscando ese lugar
Looking for paradise
Oh oh oh oh She's just a girl, and she's on fire
Hotter than a fantasy, longer like a highway
She's living in a world, and it's on fire
Feeling the catastrophe, but she knows she can fly away
Oh, she got both feet on the ground
And she's burning it down
Oh, she got her head in the clouds
And she's not backing down This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire Looks like a girl, but she's a flame
So bright, she can burn your eyes
Better look the other way
You can try but you'll never forget her name
She's on top of the world
Hottest of the hottest girls say
Oh, we got our feet on the ground
And we're burning it down
Oh, got our head in the clouds
And we're not coming down This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire Everybody stands, as she goes by
Cause they can see the flame that's in her eyes
Watch her when she's lighting up the night
Nobody knows that she's a lonely girl
And it's a lonely world
But she gon' let it burn, baby, burn, baby This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire
Oh, oh, oh,
She's just a girl, and she's on fire Used to dream of being a millionaire, without a care
But if I'm seeing my dreams and you aren't there
'Cause it's over
That just wont be fair
Darling
Rather be a poor woman living on the street
No food to eat
'Cause I don't want no pie if I have to cry
'Cause it's over
When you said goodbye! All at once
I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything
Now that you're gone
From afar, seems I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything
Since you're gone Now I see myself through different eyes
It's no surprise!
Being alone will make you realize
When it's over!
All in love is fair I shoulda been there
I shoulda been there, I shoulda shoulda All at once
I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything
Now that you're gone
From afar, seems I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything
Since you're gone I know I pushed you away
What can I do that would save our love
Take these material things
They don't mean nothing
It's you that I want All at once
I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything
Now that you're gone
From afar
Seems I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything
Since you're gone I shoulda been there
I shoulda been there, I shoulda, I shoulda All at once
I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything
Now that you're gone
From afar
Seems I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything
Since you're gone Get so caught up everyday
Tryna keep it all together
While the time it slips away
You see I know nothing last forever Imagine there was no tomorrow
Imagine that I couldn't see your face
There would be no limit to my sorrow
So all I can say I wanna tell you something, give you something
Show you in so many ways
'Cause it would all mean nothing if I don't say something before it all goes away
Don't wanna wait to bring you flowers, waste another hour let alone another day
I'm gonna tell you something, show you something, won't wait till it's too late (I can't wait, I can't wait, I won't wait, I don't wanna wait)
(I can't wait, I can't wait, I won't wait, I don't wanna wait) Just a simple conversation
Just a moment is all it takes
I wanna be there just to listen
(I wanna be here)
And I don't wanna hesitate Imagine there was no tomorrow
Imagine that I couldn't see your face
There would be no limit to my sorrow
'Cause there's nothing that could fill that space
I don't wanna put it off for too long
I didn't say all that I had to say
I wanna take my time and right the wrong before we get to that place I wanna tell you something, give you something
Show you in so many ways
'Cause it would all mean nothing if I don't say something before it all goes away
Don't wanna wait to bring you flowers, waste another hour let alone another day
I'm gonna tell you something, show you something, won't wait till it's too late Just lean on my shoulder,
It's not over till it's over

I can't wait, I can't wait, I won't wait, I don't wanna wait Oooh oooh, New York (x2) Grew up in a town,
That is famous as a place of movie scenes
Noise is always loud
There are sirens all around
And the streets are mean
If I could make it here
I could make it anywhere
That's what they say
Seeing my face in lights
Or my name in marquees found down Broadway Even if it ain't all it seems
I got a pocketful of dreams
Baby, I'm from [Chorus]
New York, concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York, New York, New York On the avenue, there ain't never a curfew
Ladies work so hard
Such a melting pot on the corner selling rock
Preachers pray to God
Hail a gypsy cab
Takes me down from Harlem to the Brooklyn Bridge
Someone sleeps tonight with a hunger
For more than from an empty fridge I'm going to make it by any means
I got a pocketful of dreams
Baby, I'm from [Chorus: x2] One hand in the air for the big city

Into a tragedy Yeah, a door left open
A woman walking by
A drop in the water
A look in the eye
A phone on the table
A man on your side
Someone that you think
That you can trust is just
Another way to die Another tricky little gun
Giving solace to the one
That will never see
The sunshine
Another inch of your life
Sacrificed
For your brother
In the nick of time
Another dirty money
Heaven sent honey
Turning on a dime Well, a door left open

Baby Baby Weren't you the one that said
That you don't want me anymore
And how you need your space
And give the keys back to your door
And how I cried and tried
And tried to make you stay with me
But still you said the love was gone
And that I had to leave (Now you) talkin' bout a family
(Now you) sayin' I complete your dream
(Now you) sayin' I'm your everything
You're confusing me, what you say to me
Don't play with me, don't play with me, 'cause (What goes around, comes around
What goes up, must come down)
Now who's cryin', desirin' to come back to me
(What goes around, comes around
What goes up, must come down)
Now who's cryin', desirin' to come back I remember when I was sittin' home alone
Waiting for you 'til three o'clock in the morn' And when you came home
You'd always have some sorry excuse
Half explaining to me
Like I'm just some kind of a fool
I sacrificed the things I want
Just to do things for you
But when it's time to do for me
You never come through (Now you) wanna be up under me
(Now you) have so much to say to me, hey
(Now you) want to make time for me

Waiting for you 'til three o'clock in the morn'
Night after night, knowing somethin' goin' on
Wasn't long before I be g-g-gone
Lord knows it wasn't easy, believe me
Never thought you'd be the one that would deceive me
And never do what you supposed to do
No need to approach me boo, 'cause I'm over you (What goes around, comes around
What goes up, must come down)
Now who's cryin', desirin' to come back to me

What goes up, must come down)
Now who's cryin', desirin' to come back to me Can't wait till I get home

That I would want someone to hold me
Show me like you, falling in a daze
So many ways, I'm in amazement Thinking about you, no one took the time
To hold my mind, and be the kind
That I could talk to, this is the type of day
That I must say, I've been looking forward to Look at me shedding no tears
No worries followed by fear
So good that soon you'll be here
They just don't know how good it feels Feels so good to not be searching
Searching just to find that someone
Feels so good to not be searching
Knowing that I found that right one I'm waiting for your love
Waiting for your love
I'm waiting for your love
Waiting for your love Talking on the phone
When I'm alone, I'm in the zone
And tempted to touch you
Nothing ever fades The way you take time for me
It makes me want you, call it what you want
It may be wrong but baby I'm your fool
I can verify that you're my type
The things we try that others just won't do Look at me shedding no tears
No worries followed by fear
So good that soon you'll be here

Searching just to find that someone
Feels so good to not be searching
Knowing that I found that right one I'm waiting for your love

Waiting for your love Some people they call me crazy
For falling in love with you
They can take me and lock me away baby
'Cause there is nothing those bars can do I will be the rising moon after setting sun
Just to let you know that you'll always have someone
I will be the clearest day when the rain is done
So you will always know Through a shake of an earthquake
I will never fall
That's how strong my love is
Like a ship through the storm
We can risk it all
That's how strong my love is I use to feel kinda lonely
'Cause the world it can be so fake
And all that matters I'm telling you
Is you and me only
And the fortunes of love we make I will be the water you need in the desert land
Just to let you know you will always have my hand
I will be the woman you need to be a better man
So you will always know Through a shake of an earthquake
I will never fall
That's how strong my love is
Like a ship through the storm
We can risk it all
That's how strong my love is Oh, can nothing break us down
Oh, cause we are heaven bound
Like the mountain standing tall
And moving over here to stay
Oh, can nothing get in the way Through a shake of an earthquake
I will never fall (I will never fall)
That's how strong my love is
(that's how strong my love my love is)
Like a ship through the storm
We can risk it all (we can risk it all)

And it was raining
Just to rub it in

I'm back on solid ground
Can't let it get me down It's alright It's alright It's alright It's alright It's alright It's alright It's alright Yes I was burned but I called it a lesson learned
Mistake overturned
So I call it a lesson learned
My soul has returned
So I call it a lesson learned
Another lesson learned Sometimes
Some lies
Can take a minute
To fully realize
His tears
Your eyes
Thirty seconds to apologize
You give it one more chance
Just like the time before
But he already know you'd give a hundred more
Until that night in bed
You wake up in a sweat
You're racing to the door
Can't take it anymore I was burned but I called it a lesson learned
Mistake overturned
So I call it a lesson learned
My soul has returned
So I call it a lesson learned
Another lesson learned Life perfect
Ain't perfect
If you don't know what the struggle's for
Falling down ain't falling down
If you don't cry when you hit the floor
It's called the past cause I'm getting past
And I ain't nothing like I was before
You ought to see me now Yes I was burned but I called it a lesson learned
Mistake overturned
So I call it a lesson learned
My soul has returned
So I call it a lesson learned
Another lesson learned Yes I was burned but I called it a lesson learned
Mistake overturned
So I call it a lesson learned
My soul has returned
So I call it a lesson learned I keep your picture upside my bed (umm)
And I still remember everything you said (umm)
I always thought our love was so right
I guess I was wrong (oh)
Always thought you'll be by my side
Pappa, now you're gone
What I wanna know baby, if what we had was good
How come you don't call me, anymore Still like a fire on a rainy night
I still like it better when you holding me tight
Everybody said, everybody said, that we should never part, no no
Telling me baby baby baby why
Why you wanna go and break my heart
All I wanna know is baby, if what we had was good
How come you don't call me anymore Sometimes it feels like I'm gonna die
If you don't call me, pappa
Oh, you got to try
I'll get down on me knees hoping you please
Please (oh oh)
Won't you call me sometime, pappa Why don't you call me
Why on earth can't you just pick up the phone
You know I don't like to be alone
How come you don't call me (why must you torture me)
How come you don't call me
How come you don't call me There's a hole in my heart I've been hiding
I've been strong for so long that I'm blind
Is there a place I can go where the lonely river flows?
Where fear ends and faith begins Hallelujah, hallelujah, let me in
I've been praying but I'm paying for my sins
Won't you give me a sign before I lose my mind?
Woah, hallelujah, let me in Every step makes me think that I'm closer
But somehow I just never arrived
When our hope disappears, please protect me from my tears
I need you right by my side Hallelujah, hallelujah, let me in
I've been praying but I'm paying for my sins
Won't you give me a sign before I lose my mind?
Woah, hallelujah, let me in Woah, woah, hallelujah
Woah, woah, hallelujah
All the places I've been
Please forgive me for my sins
Woah, hallelujah, let me in Woah, woah, let me in
Woah, woah, let me in
Woah, woah
Please forgive me for my sins
Woah, hallelujah, let me in Ooh, yeah

That you know you got me under wraps, locks and keys and
And that without you I just, I'm gonna be lost
But I got somethin' else for you Baby, I used to sit home waitin' for your call

We've got it twisted in this lucid dream
Baptized in boundaries, schooled in sin
Divided by difference, sexuality and skin Oh, so we can hate each other and fear each other
We can build these walls between each other
Baby, blow by blow and brick by brick
Keep yourself locked in, yourself locked in
Yeah, we can hate each other and fear each other
We can build these walls between each other
Baby, blow by blow and brick by brick
Keep yourself locked in, yourself locked Oh, maybe we should love somebody
Oh, maybe we could care a little more
So maybe we should love somebody
Instead of polishing the bombs of holy war What if sex was holy and war was obscene
And it wasn't twisted, what a wonderful dream
Living for love, unafraid of the end
Forgiveness is the only real revenge Oh, so we can heal each other and fill each other
We can break these walls between each other
Baby, blow by blow and brick by brick
Keep yourself open, yourself open
Yeah, we can heal each other and fill each other
We can break these walls between each other
Baby, blow by blow and brick by brick
Keep yourself open, you're open So maybe we should love somebody
Maybe we could care a little more
So maybe we should love somebody
Instead of polishing the bombs of holy war What if love is holy and hate obscene
We should give life to this beautiful dream
'Cause peace and love ain't so far
If we nurse our wounds before they scar
Nurse our wounds before they scar There will never come a day
You will ever hear me say
That I want, or need to be without you
I wanna give my all Baby just hold me
Sweetly control me
Because your arms
they keep away the lonely When I look into your eyes
Then I realize
All I need is you in my life
All I need is you in my life 'Cause I never felt this way about loving
No
Never felt so alive
Baby
Never felt this way about loving
It feels so good And everybody know the story of David and Goliath
But this is bigger than triumph
This is for the warrior, this is for you and I
This is for euphoria, give me a piece of mind
God is recording this! won't you look in the sky?
Tell him you got the behavior of your neighbor
Even when stability's never in your favor
Fly with the turbulence, only last a minute
Land on your dreams, and recognize you live it
Walk through the valley of peace, with bare feet
Run through the flames, that's more passion for me
I passed that, this morning just so the world can see
Got them wolves on me, no watch me like em clean
I know, i know, my pride, my ghost, my eyes
My lows, i know i know, its mind control
I know i could prosper, no impostor
Prosecute my posture
I stand up and I stand by it what I am a freedom fighter, the name that history wrote
And even through disaster, eye of the tiger for hope
I'm trying to find my way back, there's no day off for heroes
And even when I'm tired, gold is the only word i know And the night is takin' over
And the moonlight gets exposure
And the players have been chosen
And it seems like fate has spoken
When it seems your faith has broken
By the second, losin' focus
Ain't no way to get off, get off, get off, get off
Unless you
I bet you wonder how I go on Ill simply say its on again, its on again
The world don't stop, it's on again I am a lonely hero, trying to fight my battles
Life likes to blow the cold wind, sometimes it freezes my shadow
In the midst of all this darkness, i sacrifice my ego
There is no room for selfish, we do it for the people And the night is takin' over
And the moonlight gets exposure
And the players have been chosen
And it seems like fate has spoken
When it seems your faith has broken
By the second, losin' focus
Ain't no way to get off, get off, get off, get off
Unless you
I bet you wonder how I go on The work don't stop, 'cause they don't stop
And everybody here trying to get on top
Everybody from the burbs down to the block
Gotta hold on tight and don't let go, let go
Nah
So you think you're hot?
Gotta grind hard, give it all you got
You can have, or you can have not
You see that a lot in the ghetto (ghetto) And the night is takin' over
And the moonlight gets exposure
And the players have been chosen
And it seems like fate has spoken
When it seems your faith has broken
By the second, losin' focus
Ain't no way to get off, get off, get off, get off
Unless you
I bet you wonder how I go on Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power, yeah
Some people live just to play the game Some people think that the physical things define what's within
And I've been there before, and that life's a bore
So full of the superficial Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, yeah Some people search for a fountain
That promises forever young
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way to prove you love them Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be
With no one to share, with no one who truly cares for me Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, yeah If I ain't got you with me baby
So nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing
If I ain't got you with me baby I just want you close
Where you can stay forever
You can be sure
That it will only get better
You and me together
Through the days and nights
I dont worry cuz
Everythings going to be alright
People keep talking they can say what they like
But all i know is everythings going to be alright No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what Im feeling
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you, ...you, ...you
Can get in the way of what I feel for you When the rain is pouring down
And my heart is hurting
You will always be around
This I know for certain
You and me together
Through the days and nights
I dont worry cuz
Everythings going to be alright
People keep talking they can say what they like
But all i know is everythings going to be alright No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what Im feeling
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you, ...you, ...you
Can get in the way of what I feel I know some people search the world

You would know all everybody talk about is who got beef
Who snitchin', who told police
Who came home, who still gone, who restin' in peace Now they killin' over music money, not drugs, rap replaced it
Because thugs with no brains got no patience
New jacks I pistol whip 'em with the funky rhythm I be kickin'
Musician and flatten composition A pain, I'm like Saddam Hussein
Still alive lookin' at his dead children's burnt remains
I burnt the game, learnt you lames a new lesson
Your crew's soft man, ya'll need some new weapons The P's breathe Warriorz and skullies and Timmies
Around mixed, spics, niggaz and giddies
From my ghetto kings in deep thought we don't blink
But don't think we wastin' our time
It's a New York State of Mind New York, New York, New York
New York City, whoa oh
New York, New York, New York
New York City, baby It's like a jungle, out here
So much struggle, out here
And my dream's still unphased
Greed still the cousin of death Always feels like always somethin' farther time
In the Streets of New York All I see is street homes
And who it's holdin', our people
Only comforts the brain
It's like I'm going insane The revolution has to start, don't waste no time
In the Streets of New York (New York state of mind)
C'mon New York, New York, New York, New York oh
State of mind (New York City)
New York, New York, New York, New York oh
State of crime (New York City)
New York, New York, New York, New York oh
Big dreams (New York City)
New York, New York, New York, New York oh
Big schemes Oh, it's like the game
Just ain't the same
Baby loves and girls with no shame
Can't get away (get away), epidemic plague
Every hood in every state
Don't have no reasons 'cause relief is hard to find In the streets of New York (New York state of mind)
In the streets of New York (New York state of mind)
In the streets of New York (New York state of mind)
In the streets of New York (New York state of mind) I'm from the home of a million legends and trend settin'
A lot of footsteps to follow, I've been steppin'
Mind stressin' tryin' to find a record crime shreddin'
Time precious, I ain't have rest since nine eleven I live fast, hustle like today is my last
I get cash, the struggle's like a day on the Ave.
Crack bein' raw, gats squeezin' off
Manhattan squeezin' off, from cats who tease with war The eve of the Apocalypse, evil keep movin' politics
Every block is at risk, the metropolitan metropolis
The opposite of Liza Minelli and Frank Sinatra
Alicia Keys, Nas and Ra the gangsta's opera So New York City walk with me, talk gritty
It's up to us New York it's our city
Here the man come with the anthem, hands up
It's time the thrill is back New York, let's stand up New York, New York, New York

And I still remember everything you said (umm)
I always thought our love was so right
I guess I was wrong (oh)
Always thought you'll be by my side
Pappa, now you're gone
What I wanna know baby, if what we had was good
How come you don't call me, anymore Still like a fire on a rainy night
I still like it better when you holding me tight
Everybody said, everybody said, that we should never part, no no
Telling me baby baby baby why
Why you wanna go and break my heart
All I wanna know is baby, if what we had was good
How come you don't call me anymore Sometimes it feels like I'm gonna die
If you don't call me, pappa
Oh, you got to try
I'll get down on me knees hoping you please
Please (oh oh)
Won't you call me sometime, pappa Why don't you call me
Why on earth can't you just pick up the phone
You know I don't like to be alone
How come you don't call me (why must you torture me)
How come you don't call me
How come you don't call me Na na na na no
No no no
Na na na na no
No no no The sand loves when, the waves come
The sky can't wait, for the light of the sun
So how could you, look me in my eye
And not see what what I feel inside
Tell me how could you, doubt the fact that I
I love you,
I love you Don't you ever, think like that.
Don't you ever, never do that?
There will never be two things, that go together better
Than you and me North needs south east needs west,
And no needs, yes yes yes
Up needs down life needs death,
And no needs, yes yes yes I need you
I need you
I need you
You, I need you
No no no
So how could you
Look me in my eye
And not see what what I feel inside
Tell me how could you
Doubt the fact that I
I love you,
I love you Don't you ever,
Think like that
Don't you ever,
Never do that?
There will never be two things
That go together better
Than you and me North needs south east needs west,
And no needs,
Yes yes yes
Up needs down life needs death,
And no needs,
Yes yes yes I need you
Oh baby I need you
No no no
Everyday, I need you
Na na na na no
You, I need you
No no no
Hey hey hey
I need you
No no no
Hey hey hey
Like the desert needs the rain
Like joy needs pain Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power, yeah
Some people live just to play the game Some people think that the physical things define what's within
And I've been there before, and that life's a bore
So full of the superficial Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, yeah Some people search for a fountain
That promises forever young
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way to prove you love them Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be
With no one to share, with no one who truly cares for me Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, yeah If I ain't got you with me baby
So nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing
If I ain't got you with me baby I just want you close
Where you can stay forever
You can be sure
That it will only get better
You and me together
Through the days and nights
I don?t worry 'cause
Everythings gonna be alright
People keep talking
They can say what they like
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one no one no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you
You you
Can get in the way of what I feel for you When the rain is pouring down
And my heart is hurting
You will always be around
This I know for certain You and me together
Through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause
Everythings gonna be alright
People keep talking
They can say what they like
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one no one no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you
You you
Can get in the way of what I feel for you I know some people search the world
To find something like what we have
I know people will try
Try to divide
Something so real
So till the end of time
I?m telling you that No one no one no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one no one no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you
Oh oh oh Sometimes I feel like I don't belong anywhere
It's gonna take so long for me to get somewhere
Sometimes I feel so heavy hearted
But I can't explain 'cause I'm so guarded But that's a lonely road to travel
And a heavy load to bear
And it's a long, long way to heaven
But I gotta get there Can you send an angel?
Can you send an angel? 'Cause I don't wanna feel
Like a dove with no wings
And I don't wanna know
What a heart of stone would bring But that's a lonely road to travel
And a heavy load to bear
And it's a long, long way to heaven
But I gotta get there Can you send an angel?
Can you send me an angel?
Please, send me an angel
Can you send me an angel? To guide me, to guide me home
[Incomprehensible] so bad, so bad right now
Oh, won't you be somebody's angel right now And the day came
When the risk it took to remain tightly closed in a bud
Was more painfully than the risk it took to bloom
This is the element of freedom I'll make the darkness light before you,
What is wrong I'll make it right before you,
All the battles I will fight down for you,
And the high place I'll bring down. And the high place I'll bring down. Mm, bye bye How do you love someone
That hurts you, oh, so bad
With intentions good?
Was all he ever had Well, how do I let go when I've loved him for so long
And I've given him all that I could? Maybe love is a hopeless crime
Giving up what seems your lifetime
What went wrong with something once so good? How do you find the words to say
To say, to say (to say goodbye) goodbye
(Find the words to say goodbye)
When your heart don't have the heart to say
To say, to say (to say goodbye) goodbye
(Find the words to say goodbye) I know now I was naive
Never knew where this would lead, yeah
And I'm not tryin' to take away, oh no
From the good man that he is Well, how do I let go when I've
Loved him for so long and I've
Given him all that I could? Was it something wrong that we did?
Or 'cause others infiltrated?
What went wrong with something once so good? How do you find the words to say
To say, to say (to say goodbye) goodbye
(Find the words to say goodbye)
When your heart don't have the heart to say
To say goodbye
Find the words to say goodbye) Is this the end? Are you sure?
How should you know
When you've never been here before?
It's so hard to just let go
And this is the one and only love I've ever known, so (How do you find the words to say, to say goodbye
When your heart don't have the heart to say
When your heart don't have the heart to say
To say goodbye
Find the words to say goodbye) How do you find the words to say
To say goodbye When I wake up in the morning baby
Can't believe my eyes
It is this a part of destiny, you're now in my life (now in my life)
There is no better prize
Can't compare to you
Ain't no words to describe the way that I'm feeling, yeah
When I look at you I'm just speechless baby, don't know what to say
I'm just speechless baby, the poet in me has gone away
I'm just speechless baby, don't know what to say
I just speechless baby, the poet in me has gone away, yeah, yeah True love finally found you baby
Life becomes a way
Prettiest things imagine up, oh yea
Listen I don't wanna say
It only happens once to me when I call
Feel it deep in your soul
And like a fairy tale your story begins
What a saint to the ... I'm just speechless baby, don't know what to say
I'm just speechless baby, the poet in me has gone away
I'm just speechless baby, don't know what to say
I just speechless baby, the poet in me has gone away, yeah, yeah Hey yeah, in the mornings when I rise up
Go to the window and I smile with my eyes up
Staring at clouds like wow look at my love
Every day I'm feeling better cause I know I got the best I can be proud of
We came for quit, remember when I used to tell my girls like yo this dude thinks he's all eh, think he's so fly
And hates how you try to talk to me I'm like you're don't even there try
I was on my solo groove, I ain't want nothing, I ain't need nothing
Man I'm good, now I'm speechless, cause I fell for it, the poet in me died cause I fell for it I'm just speechless baby, don't know what to say
I'm just speechless baby, the poet in me has gone away
I'm just speechless baby, don't know what to say
I just speechless baby, the poet in me has gone away, yeah, yeah I used to know all the words to say, I used to write all the poetry
But now you take my breath away, hahaha, hey. Oooh oooh, New York (x2) Grew up in a town,
That is famous as a place of movie scenes
Noise is always loud
There are sirens all around
And the streets are mean
If I could make it here
I could make it anywhere
That's what they say
Seeing my face in lights
Or my name in marquees found down Broadway Even if it ain't all it seems
I got a pocketful of dreams
Baby, I'm from [Chorus]
New York, concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York, New York, New York On the avenue, there ain't never a curfew
Ladies work so hard
Such a melting pot on the corner selling rock
Preachers pray to God
Hail a gypsy cab
Takes me down from Harlem to the Brooklyn Bridge
Someone sleeps tonight with a hunger
For more than from an empty fridge I'm going to make it by any means
I got a pocketful of dreams
Baby, I'm from [Chorus: x2] One hand in the air for the big city
Street lights, big dreams, all looking pretty
No place in the world that can compared
Put your lighters in the air
Everybody say yeah, yeah yeah [Chorus] Oh, oh, A-K!
New day
Oh, oh, A-K!
Ow! Party people say, party people say, "Aye
It's a new day, it's a new day"
World is gettin' ready, everybody's ready, yeah!
For a new day, for a new day,
Celebrate and say aye, aye, aye, aye aye (aye) It's alright to, to feel however you want to
There's no limitation, no
Fill up your life, let me see your hands up one time
We'll celebrate mine, 'cause I ain't gonna get no more
So we can do this all night, one time
Everybody say, "Aye aye oh" (oh) There's a feeling that I got that I can't give up
Feeling in my heart that I can't get over
I know that it's coming, let the sun come up
Tell me do you feel the same? Everybody say Party people say, party people say, "Aye
It's a new day, it's a new day"
World is gettin' ready, everybody's ready, yeah!
For a new day, for a new day,

Aye, come alive let's get it
Aye, if you wanna touch the sky, hands in the air one time
All night and all day
I'mma live it loud like there's only one life left to live it up
One life left to live it up There's a feeling that I got that I can't give up
Feeling in my heart that I can't get over
I know that it's coming, let the sun come up
Tell me do you feel the same? Everybody say Party people say, party people say, "Aye

For a new day, for a new day,
Celebrate and say Celebrate and say

(Celebrate) and say Check it out
It feels kinda crazy These covers
May keep me warm at night
But they can't take your place
'Cause they never gonna hold me tight And these pillows
May let me rest my head
But they can't say good night
And tuck me in before I go to bed Say now baby girl you're better off
That's what I'm telling myself (over and over)
But I'm lying to myself
'Cause I know I don't want nobody else These lips are missin' you
'Cause these lips ain't kissin' you
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win
These arms are wantin' you
'Cause these arms ain't holdin' you
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win These candles
Light up my room at night
But they can't light the room they way you did
When you walked inside, oh baby If these walls could sing
About everything they've witnessed
Oh it'd be a sad sad song
And it'll probably sound something like this Say now baby girl you're better off
That's what I'm telling myself (over and over)
But I'm lying to myself
Cause I know I don't want nobody else 'Cause these lips are missin' you (Missin' you)
'Cause these lips ain't kissin' you (Kissin' you)
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win
These arms are wantin' you (Wantin' you)
'Cause these arms ain't holdin' you (Holdin' you)
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win Tell me when the hell this loneliness is gonna be over (Gonna be over)
When everything in this room reminds me of you (You)
Every time I think, I'm getting closer
'Cause tears drown me out, once again I lose 'Cause these lips are missin' you (Missin' you)
'Cause these lips ain't kissin' you (Kissin' you)
I put up a fight
But once again these tears always win
These arms are wantin' you (Wantin' you)
'Cause these arms ain't holdin' you (Holdin' you)
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win Crying like oh oh
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win
Crying like oh oh
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win And it feels so good
Don't you feel so good?
Talk to me Hey, I never been this good, not ever, not ever
Never seen this part of me
I know that nothing last forever, however
Oh, I'm not worried about tomorrow
Cause tomorrow may not come
And where my heart take me I follow, you gotta follow When they lay me down, put my soul to rest
When they ask me how I spent my life
At least I got to love you, when it's all over
When it's all said and done, when it's all over
At least I got to love you, at least I got to love you Hey, ask when I wanna leave
A lifelong legacy, me loving you and you loving me
Oh, I'm not worried about tomorrow, tomorrow
All I know, all the time we have is borrowed, I feel no sorrow When they lay me down, put my soul to rest
When they ask me how I spent my life
At least I got to love you, when it's all over
When it's all said and done, when it's all over
At least I got to love you, at least I got to love you Everybody say hey hey hey hey If I do nothing else, oh

Ev'ryone comes to stare at me
with so much joy and reverie
They don't know how I feel inside
Through my smile I cry They don't know what they're doing to me
keeping me from flying
That's why I say that I know why
the caged bird sings
Only joy comes from song She's so rare and beautiful to others
Why not just set her free
so she can fly, fly, fly
spreading her wings and her song?
Let her fly, fly, fly

Loved Christmas time and birthday was fly

Her mothers supper made me love her like she took me to prom (uh)
And shoutout to my sisters on welfare
Flacko care, nobody else care

I'll be here forever Ayo mo bee
Drop it on me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let's do it like this, uh If I was your woman
And you were my man
You'd have no other woman
You'd be weak as a lamb If you had the strength
To walk out my door
My love would over-rule my sense
And I'd call you back for more If I was your woman
If I was your woman
And you were my man, yeah She tears you down darling
Says you're nothing at all
But I'll pick you up darling
When she lets you fall 'Cause you're like a diamond
But she treats you like glass
Yet you beg her to love you
But me you won't ask If I were your woman
If I were your woman
If I was your woman Here's what I'd do
I'd never, never, no, no, no stop loving you
Yeah, yeah Life is so crazy
And love is unkind
Because she was first darling
Will she hang on your mind You're a part of me
But you don't even know it
I'm what you need
But I'm too afraid to show it If I were your woman
If I were your woman
If I were your woman Here's what I'd do
I'd never, never, no, no, no stop loving you If I were your woman
Here's what I'd do
I'd never, never, never stop loving you
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I were your woman
I were your woman
I were your woman
I were your woman
I were your woman We're at the crossroads, my dear
Where do we go from here?
Maybe you won't go, maybe you'll stay
Oh I know I'm gonna miss you either ways
It's such a lonely road [Chorus: x2]
Where do we go from here?
All I can do is, follow the tracks of my tears
Oh
When I cry your name
Am I crawling in bed
Oh and am I waiting only to drown in pain
Oh
Don't you do it
No, said don't you leave me this way
I don't know
If I can lift my head and face another day
Ooh it's such a lonely road Where do we go from here?
All I can do is, follow the tracks of my tears
You seem now the kind of girl who's lost and looking for direction
(Who could this be? Staring at me)
When I'm looking in the mirror trying to find a resolution
(Me too far gone, to find my way home) [Chorus] Where do we go from here?
All I can do is, follow the tracks of my tears Is it my turn to wish you was lying here?
I tend to dream you when I'm not sleeping
Is it my turn to fictionalize my world?
Or even imagine your emotions, tell myself anything Is it my turn to take you by your hands?
Tell you, I love you and you not hear me
Is it my turn to totally understand?
Watch you walk out of my life and not do a damn thing If I have to give away, every feeling that I feel,
If I have to sacrifice, oh, whatever babe, whatever baby
If I have to take apart, all that I am
Is there anything that I would not do, inside I'd die without you
Inside I'd die without you, yeah babe Oh I apologize for all the things I've done
Now I'm underwater and I'm drowning
Is it my turn to be the one to cry?
Isn't it amazing how some things completely turn around?
Oh, take every little piece of my heart (Piece of my heart)
Take every little piece of my soul (Piece of my soul)
Take every little piece of my mind
'Cause if you're gone, inside, I'd die without you Yeah 'cause inside I'd die without you
Yeah baby I'd die without you
Can't you see that I would die without you? If I have to give away, every feeling that I feel,
If I have to sacrifice, oh, whatever babe, whatever baby
If I have to take apart, all that I am
Is there anything that I would not do, inside I'd die without you Yeah I'd die without you
Oh don't you know that I would, die without you
Baby, see I would die without, I'd die without you
Oh die without you, die without you babe
I don't know what I'd do without you babe Have you ever felt so strong
That may you feel weak
Long days
Long nights

I'll give you all of my time Sometimes I feel
Like I don't belong anywhere
And it's gonna take so long
For me to get somewhere
Sometimes I feel
So heavy hearted
But I can't explain
Cause I'm so guarded But that's a lonely road to travel
And a heavy load to bare
And it's a long, long way to heaven
But I gotta get there
Can you send an angel?
Can you send me an angel?
Guide me In the morning when you wake
When I wanna face today and all your heartache
Thinking how much can you take
Please don't ever loose a faith and don't fall under In a world that seems to get colder and colder
Don't you worry cause
My love will only get stronger and stronger Cause I I I I I'm gonna love you gonna hold ya through it all
I I I I'm gonna love you gonna never let you fall
Through it all
Through it all Don't think about the past, don't worry bout the future
Just live in the moment
Long as there's another day here will be another way
A chance to make it through In a world that seems to get colder and colder
Don't you worry cause
My love will only get stronger and stronger Cause I I I I I'm gonna love you gonna hold ya through it all
I I I I'm gonna love you gonna never let you fall
Through it all When you're down and out
Loosing dignity
Don't let go of me (hold on)
Surely there's is a brighter day right in front of me (hold on)
If you really looked inside
You would finally realize
You don't have to cry (no more)
All you have to do is see
That you can believe in me
And I will never leave Cause I I I I I'm gonna love you gonna hold ya through it all
I I I I'm gonna love you gonna never let you fall
Through it all Remembering the days when our love began
Thinkin' of a million ways
To escape and be with you
But reality wasn't just you and I
It was long drawn out days and lonely nights Dreamin' bout you
I keep dreamin' bout you
When I'm dreamin' bout when you would say [Chorus]
Let me take you to another place
Where nothing ever seems to matter
Its just you and me
We can take flight like a thief in the night
Stolen moments with you (oh oh) Destiny didn't have such a simple plan (simple plan)
I was just a girl and you a young man
How could age define
Something so divine (so divine)
Can this even be real or just exist in my mind Dreamin' bout you
I keep dreamin' 'bout you
When I'm dreamin' 'bout when you would say [Chorus] Dreamin' bout you
I keep dreamin' bout you
When I'm dreamin and waiting for the day
When no one and nothing else takes up our time
Finally you're only mine Each and everyday
I don't walk with you right by my side
But instead we have to hide
Sneak around and lie
Just to spend time alone
This lovin is a crime
I'd rather do the time
And leave the world behind [Chorus] Let's get away
Let's get away
Oh oh We can get away
We can get away
Oh oh Let's get away
Let's get away
Oh oh We can get away
We can get away
Oh oh Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now
Look around, look around Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now
Look around, look around Look at where you are
Look at where you started
The fact that you're alive is a miracle
Just stay alive
That would be enough And if this child
Shares a fraction of your smile
Or a fragment of your mind, look out world!
That would be enough I don't pretend to know
The challenges you're facing
The worlds you keep erasing and creating in your mind But I'm not afraid
I know who I married
So long as you come home at the end of the day
That would be enough We don't need a legacy
We don't need money
If I could grant you peace of mind
If you could let me inside your heart Oh, let me be a part of the narrative
In the story they will write someday
Let this moment be the first chapter:
Where you decide to stay And I would be enough
And this could be enough
This would be enough Said, I would be enough
And this could be enough
See, we could be enough
Oh baby I could be enough
We could be enough
This could be enough
Ooh Don't look no further
Don't go nowhere
I could be enough (I could be enough)
We could have it all Tell me baby (baby)
Can you feel me? (ay)
Can I be enough? (Can I be enough?)
And your family? (Me and your family?)
Listen, baby (Listen, baby)
We can have it all (We could have it all)
Can I be enough? (Can I be enough?)
Yeah
Woo So look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now
Look around, look around Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now
Look around, look around

That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me, it isn't over Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me, it isn't over Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste? Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
[Clean version:] Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
[Explicit version:] Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare
See how I leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch
And it's bringing me out the dark The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it, to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you
And I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there
As mine sure won't be shared (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love remind me of us
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
I can't help feeling
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it, to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it, with a beating Throw your soul through every open door (woah)
Count your blessings to find what you look for (woah)
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (woah)
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow (woah)
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could have had it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
It all, it all, it all

I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet There's such a difference between us
And a million miles Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly
Doesn't tear you apart anymore Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened? It's no secret
That the both of us
Are running out of time So hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly
Doesn't tear you apart anymore Oh, anymore
Oh, anymore
Oh, anymore
Anymore Hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly
Doesn't tear you apart anymore I will leave my heart at the door
I won't say a word
They've all been said before you know
So why don't we just play pretend
Like we're not scared of what's coming next
Or scared of having nothing left Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again? I don't need your honesty
It's already in your eyes
And I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that matters
Tell me who do I run to? Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again? Let this be our lesson in love
Let this be the way we remember us
I don't wanna be cruel or vicious
And I ain't asking for forgiveness
All I ask is If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again? I let it fall, my heart,
And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands, they're strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cry
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name When laying with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here, forever
You and me together, nothing gets better Cause there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Where I felt something die, 'cause I knew that
That was the last time, the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door
As if that heart you caught is still waiting for you
Even now when it's already over
I can't help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Where I felt something die
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time, oh
Oh, oh Let it burn, oh
Let it burn
Let it burn Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk
To the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home
You're like a dream come true
But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment
Before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song I was so scared to face my fears
Nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swore you moved overseas
That's what you said, when you left me You still look like a movie
You still sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young It's hard to win me back
Everything just takes me back
To when you were there
To when you were there
And a part of me keeps holding on
Just in case it hasn't gone
I guess I still care
Do you still care? It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old
It makes me reckless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
When we were young Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am home again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am whole again Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am young again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am fun again However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I will always love you Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am free again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am clean again However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I will always love you However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
'Cause I love you When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
no doubt in my mind were you belong I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the Earth for you
To make you feel my love To make you feel my love I've made up my mind
Don't need to think it over
If I'm wrong I am right
Don't need to look no further
This ain't lust
I know this is love but If I tell the world
I'll never say enough
Cause it was not said to you
And that's exactly what I need to do
If I'm in love with you Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste?
Even If I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere I'd build myself up
And fly around in circles
Waiting as my heart drops
And my back begins to tingle
Finally could this be it or Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste?
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere yeah Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if, it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste?
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up,
Or should I just keep on chasing pavements?
Should I just keep on chasing pavements? Or Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste?
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere When will I see you again?
You left with no goodbye, not a single word was said
No final kiss to seal anything
I had no idea of the state we were in I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head
But don't you remember, don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before,
Baby please remember me once more When was the last time you thought of me?
Or have you completely erased me from your memories?
I often think about where I went wrong
The more I do, the less I know But I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head
But don't you remember, don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby please remember me once more Oh, I gave you the space so you could breathe
I kept my distance so you would be free
In hope that you find the missing piece
To bring you back to me Why don't you remember, don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby please remember me once more
When will I see you again? She, she ain't real
She ain't gonna be able to love you like I will
She is a stranger
You and I have history
Or don't you remember
Sure, she's got it all
But, baby, is that really what you want Bless your soul, you've got you're head in the clouds
You made a fool out of you
And, boy, she's bringing you down
She made your heart melt
But you're cold to the core
Now rumor has it she ain't got your love anymore Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh She is half your age
But I'm guessing that's the reason that you stayed
I heard you've been missing me
You've been telling people things that you shouldn't be
Like when we creep out and she ain't around
Haven't you heard the rumors Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
You made a fool out of me
And, boy, you're bringing me down
You made my heart melt, yet I'm cold to the core
But rumor has it I'm the one you're leaving her for Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh

Tell a story that I cannot bear to hear
Just 'cause I said it, it don't mean that I meant it
People say crazy things
Just 'cause I said it, don't mean that I meant it
Just 'cause you heard it Rumor has it, ooh,

I grow fonder every day
Lose myself in time
Just thinking of your face
God only knows why it's taken me
So long to let my doubts go
You're the only one that I want I don't know why I'm scared
I've been here before
Every feeling, every word
I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forget your past and simply be mine I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
I promise I'm worthy
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts If I've been on your mind
You hang on every word I say
Lose yourself in time
At the mention of my name
Will I ever know how it feels to hold you close
And have you tell me
Whichever road I choose, you'll go? I don't know why I'm scared
'Cause I've been here before
Every feeling, every word
I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forget your past and simply be mine I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
I promise I'm worthy, mm
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
Nobody's perfect
(I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
Trust me I've learned it
Nobody's perfect
(I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
Trust me I've learned it
Nobody's perfect

I promise I'm worthy
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove that I am the, one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts Come on and give me the chance
To prove that I am the one who can, walk that mile
Until the end starts If you're not the one for me
Then I'll come back and bring you to your knees
If you're not the one for me
Why do I hate the idea of being free?
And if I'm not the one for you
You've gotta stop holding me the way you do
Oh when you found that the one for you
Why have we been through what we have been through It's so cold out here in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge What are you waiting for?
You never seem to make it through the door
And who are you hiding from?
It ain't no life to live like you're on the run
Have I ever asked for much?
The only thing that I want is your love If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge It's so cold in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge I've been walking in the same way as I did
Missing out the cracks in the pavement
And turning my heel and strutting my feet
"Is there anything I can do for you dear?
Is there anyone I could call?"
"No and thank you, please Madam.
I ain't lost, just wandering" Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Ooh the people I've met
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of now I like it in the city when the air is so thick and opaque
I love to see everybody in short skirts, shorts and shades
I like it in the city when two worlds collide
You get the people and the government
Everybody taking different sides Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united
Shows that we ain't gonna take it
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Ooh the people I've met yea Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of my world
Of my world, yeah
Of my world
Of my world, yeah Close enough to start a war
All that I have is on the floor
God only knows what we're fighting for
All that I say, you always say more I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe So I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't ask you, you to just desert me
I can't give you what you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables, to turning tables Under haunted skies I see
Where love is lost, your ghost is found
I've braved a hundred storms to leave you
As hard as you try, no, I will never be knocked down I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe So I won't let you close enough to hurt me, no
I won't ask you, you to just desert me
I can't give you what you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables, turning tables Next time I'll be braver, I'll be my own savior
When the thunder calls to me
Next time I'll be braver, I'll be my own savior
Standing on my own two feet I won't let you close enough to hurt me, no
I won't ask you, you to just desert me
I can't give you what you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables, to turning tables
Turning tables, yeah, turning This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the earth move and then
Hear my heart burst again For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall
At skyfall Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number, you can take my name
But you'll never have my heart Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me
Without the security
Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall Let the sky fall
We will stand tall
At skyfall Just the guitar This was all you, none of it me
You put your hands all over my body and told me, umm
You told me you were ready
For the big one, for the big jump
I'd be your last love everlasting you and me
That was what you told me I'm giving you up

We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more I only wanted to have fun
Learning to fly, learning to run
I let my heart decide the way
When I was young
Deep down I must have always known
That this would be inevitable
To earn my stripes I'd have to pay
And bear my soul I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who can't stand the reflection that they see
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago When I walk around all of the streets
Where I grew up and found my feet
They can't look me in the eye
It's like they're scared of me
I try to think of things to say
Like a joke or a memory
But they don't recognize me now
In the light of day I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who never became who they thought they'd be
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago
A million years ago Looking for some education
Made my way into the night
All that bullshit conversation
Baby, can't you read the signs? I won't bore you with the details, baby
I don't even wanna waste your time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help me ease my mind
I ain't Mr. Right But if you're looking for fast love
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
Had some bad love
So fast love is all that I've got on my mind Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh Looking for some affirmation
Made my way into the sun
My friends got their ladies
And they're all having babies
I just wanna have some fun I won't bore you with the details, baby
I don't even wanna waste your time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help me ease my mind
I ain't Mr. Right But if you're looking for fast love
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
I've had some bad love
So fast love is all that I've got on my mind Ooh, ooh
Baby, baby
Ooh, ooh
Baby, baby
Ooh, ooh
Baby, baby
Ooh In the absence of security
I made my way into the night
Stupid cupid keeps on calling me
And I see nothing in his eyes
I miss my baby
Oh I, I miss my baby
I miss my baby
I miss, I miss, I miss, I miss my baby
Ooh I, I miss my baby Take your eyes off of me so I can leave
I'm far too ashamed to do it with you watching me
This is never ending, we have been here before
But I can't stay this time 'cause I don't love you anymore
Please stay where you are
Don't come any closer
Don't try to change my mind
I'm being cruel to be kind I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me You have given me something that I can't live without
You mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt
But I don't want to carry on like everything is fine
The longer we ignore it all the more that we will fight
Please don't fall apart
I can't face your breaking heart
I'm trying to be brave
Stop asking me to stay I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me We're not the only ones
I don't regret a thing
Every word I've said
You know I'll always mean
It is the world to me
That you are in my life
But I want to live
And not just survive That's why I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
'Cause ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me
And I-I-I-I-I don't think you can save me I want every single piece of you
I want your heaven and your ocean's too
Treat me soft but touch me cool
I wanna teach you things you never knew, baby
Bring the floor up to my knees
Let me fall into your gravity
And kiss me back to life to see
Your body standing over me Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Down, down, down, down I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light I love the way your body moves
Towards me from across the room
Brushing past my every groove
No one has me like you do
In your heart I bring my soul
But be delicate with my ego
I wanna step into your great unknown
With you and me setting the tone Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Down, down, down, down I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light We play so dirty in the dark
'Cause we are living worlds apart
It only makes it harder baby
It only makes it harder baby (harder baby)
Harder baby (harder baby), harder baby I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you I remember all of the things that I thought I wanted to be
So desperate to find a way out of my world and finally breathe
Right before my eyes I saw, my heart it came to life
This ain't easy it's not meant to be
Every story has its scars When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
That I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
That I will be, I will be your remedy No river is too wide or too deep for me to swim to you
Come whenever I'll be the shelter that won't let the rain come through
Your love, it is my truth
And I will always love you
Love you When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
That I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
That I will be, I will be your remedy, oh When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
I will be, I will be
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
That I will be, I will be, I will be
Your remedy, oh Didn't I give it all?
Tried my best
Gave you everything I had, everything and no less
Didn't I do it right? Did I let you down?
Maybe you got too used to having me 'round
Still how can you walk away
From all my tears
It's gonna be an empty road without me right here
But go on and take it, take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love, take it all with my love Maybe I should leave, to help you see
Nothing is better than this and this is everything we need
So is it over? Is this really it, you're giving up so easily
I thought you loved me more than this But go on, go on, take it, take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love, take it all with my love I will change if I must
Slow it down and bring it home, I will adjust
Oh if only, if only you knew
Everything I do, is for you But go on and take it, take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it, take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all, with my love
Take it all with my love
Take it all with my love This is how the story went
I met someone by accident
It blew me away
Blew me away It was in the darkest of my days
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
And buried them away, you buried them away I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away Dropped you off at the train station
Put a kiss on top of your head
Watch you wave
And watched you wave Then I went on home to my skyscrapers
And neon lights and waiting papers
That I call home
I call that home I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away, away Woke up feeling heavy-hearted
I'm going back to where I started
The morning rain, the morning rain
And though I wish that you were here
On that same old road that brought me here
It's calling me home, It's calling me home I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away
I can't spend my whole life hiding my heart away I don't want you to be no slave
I don't want you to work all day
But I want you to be true
And I just want to make love to you
Love to you, ooh baby

Turn down the bed
Turn down these voices
Inside my head Lay down with me
And tell me no lies
Just hold me closly
Don't patronize Don't patronize me 'Cause I can't make you love me
If you don't
You can't make your heart feel
Something that it won't
And even in the dark
These final hours
I will lay down my heart
I will feel the power
But you won't
No, you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me
When you don't
When you don't, yeah I'll close my eyes
'Cause then I don't see
The love you don't feel
When you're holding me Morning will come
And I'll do what's right
Just give me till then
To give up this fight And I will give up this fight 'Cause I can't make you love me

You, when you don't, yeah, yeah Hold me closer, one more time
Say that you love me in your last goodbye
Please forgive me, for my sins
Yes, I swam dirty waters
But you pushed me in
I've seen your face, under every sky
Over every border and on every line
You know my heart, more than I do
We were the greatest, me and you But we had time against us
And miles between us
The heavens cried
I know I left you speechless
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue
And I see my future in you I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll do everything different
I'll be better to you,
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll be somebody different
I'll be better to you Let me stay here for just one more night
Build your world around me
And pull me to the light
So I can tell you that I was wrong
I was a child then, but now I'm willing to learn But we had time against us
And miles between us
The heavens cried
I know I left you speechless
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue
And I see my future in you I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll do everything different
I'll be better to you
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll be somebody different
I'll be better to you Time against us
Miles between us
Heavens cried
I know I left you speechless
Time against us
Miles between us
Heavens cried
I know I left you speechless
I know I left you speechless I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll do everything different
I'll be better to you
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll be somebody different
I'll be better for you This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the Earth move, and then
Hear my heart burst again For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue, I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
At sky fall
at sky fall Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number
You can take my name
But you'll never have my heart Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
At sky fall Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me with out the security
Of your loving arms keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand.... Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
At sky fall Let the sky fall
We will stand tall
At skyfall (Verse 1)
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go head and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark Chorus 1
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling, we could've had it all... (You're gonna wish you never met me)
Rolling in the deep... (Tears are gonna fall rollin' in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never met me)
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall rollin' in the deep) Verse 2
Baby I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Making a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared (Chorus 2)
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling, we could've had it all
Rolling in the deep... you had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it to the beat
Could've had it all... Rollin' in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating (Verse 3)
Throw your stone through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow (Chorus 3)
We could've had it all... We could've had it all...
It all, It all, It all... We could've had it all...
Rollin' in the deep...
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it to the beat
Could've had it all
Rollin' in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it, you played it, you played it, you played it to the beat Some say, I'll be better without you,
They don't know you like I do,
Or at least as far as I thought I knew
I can't bear this time,
It drags, as I lose my mind
Reminded by things I find
I know some clothes you left behind.
Wake me up, wake me up when all is done
I won't rise until this battle's won
My dignity is become undone But I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go, I can't do it on my own,
If this is ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk So petrified, I'm so scared to step into this right,
What if I lose my heart and fail the ?
I won't forgive me if I gave up trying
I heard his voice today
I didn't know a single word he said
Now I'm resemblance to the man I met
Just a vague and broken boy instead But I won't go, I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go, I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk There will be times, we'll try and give it up
Bursting at the seams, no doubt
We almost fall apart and burn up easy
So watch them turn to dust
But nothing will never taint us I won't go, I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go, I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk Will he, will he still remember me?
Will he still love me even when he's free
Or will he go back to the place where
He will choose the poison over me?
When we spoke yesterday
He said to hold my breath, to sit and wait
I'll be home soon, I won't be late He won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
He's willing to take the risk
So I won't go, I can't do it on his own,
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk 'Cause he won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
We're willing to take the risk
I won't go! I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk I let it fall, my heart,
And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands, they're strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,
Your name When I lay with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together nothing gets better 'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name,
Your name I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Well, it felt something died
'Cause I knew that that was
The last time, the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door,
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,
Your name I set fire to the rain,
And I threw us into the flames
Well, it felt something died
'Cause I knew that, that was the last time
The last time Let it burn
Let it burn
Let it burn Daydreamer
Sitting on the sea
Soaking up the sun
He is a real lover
And making up the past
Feeling up his girl
Like he's never felt a figure before A jaw dropper
Looks good when he walks
Is the subject of their talk
He would be hard to chase
But good to catch
And he could change the world
With his hands behind his back, oh You can find him sittin' on your doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And you can tell that he'll be there for life Daydreamer
With eyes that make you melt
He lends his coat for shelter
Plus he's there for you
When he shouldn't be
But he stays all the same
Waits for you
Then sees you through There's no way I
Could describe him
What I'll say is
Just what I'm hoping for But I will find him sittin' on my doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And I can tell that he'll be there for life
And I can tell that he'll be there for life With your loving, there ain't nothing
That I can't adore
The way I'm running, with you, honey
Is we can break every low
I find it funny that you're the only
One I never looked for
There is something in your loving
That tears down my walls I wasn't ready then, I'm ready now
I'm heading straight for you
You will only be eternally
The one that I belong to The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I've known I'll forever be whatever you want me to be
I'll go under and all over for your clarity
When you wonder if I'm gonna lose my way home
Just remember, that come whatever, I'll be yours all alone I wasn't ready then, I'm ready now
I'm heading straight for you
You will only be eternally
The one that I belong to The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I've known I've been looking for you, baby
In every face that I've ever known
And there is something 'bout the way you love me
That finally feels like home
All my life, you're my darkness
You're the right kind of madness
And you're my hope, you're my despair
You're my scope, everything, everywhere The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I've known Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Devotion [Verse 1]
When did it go wrong, I will never know
I have loved you all my life
How did it slow down, I go round and round
Thinking about it all the time [Pre-Chorus]
I gave you heaven on a platter baby
I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me
This love, it ain't over yet
There's too much that I haven't said [Chorus]
Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write, had a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go [Verse 2]
Why were you so cold, let the truth be told
Tell me was it all for the thrill?
What was I thinking, I gave you everything
But you still went for the kill [Pre-Chorus]
I gave you heaven on a platter baby
I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me [Chorus]
Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write, had a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go [Bridge]
Oooh sometimes I feel like I'm in the dark
Oooh I thought I'd die in your arms [Chorus]
Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write, I had a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go [Outro]
Hope you know, I won't let go I thought I told you, he'd be home soon
Couldn't help myself, you're too good to be true.
I fall short each time,
Every time he ain't here
You and your charm creep closer
Closer and near
Like a fool for fire, I fall, with my pride and all.
Like a bomb before explosion,
Ticking by your call,
You're the wiser one, disguised from greed,
And I'm just a child who belongs on her knees. But I found a boy who I love more,
Than I ever did you before,
So stand beside the river I cried,
And lay yourself down.
Look how you want me now that I don't need you. So, you thought that I'd crumble to my knees
At the first sight of you crawling back to me
To whisper "will you leave your man? "
Cause you swear that this time you can stand by me.
I won't stand by you. Cause I found a boy who I love more,
Than I ever did you before,
So stand beside the river I cried
And lay yourself down.
Look how you want me now that I don't need you! I ain't yours for no taking,
You must be mistaken
I could never look into your eyes, and settle for wrong
And ignore the right When I found a boy who loves me more,
Than you ever did me before.
So stand beside the river you cried
And lay yourself down!
Look how you want me now that I don't need you! Found myself today singing out your name,
You said I'm crazy,
If I am I'm crazy for you. Sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here
Turns me crazy,
But it's you who makes me lose my head. And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head
And turn me into a crumbling fool. Tell me to run and I'll race,
If you want me to stop I'll freeze,
And if you want me gone. I'll leave, just hold me closer baby,
And make me crazy for you.
Crazy for you. Lately with this state I'm in I can't help myself but spin.
I wish you'd come over,
Send me spinning closer to you. My oh my, how my blood boils, it's sweet taste for you,
Strips me down bare
And gets me into my favorite mood. I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away,
But the more I do,
The crazier I turn into. Pacing floors and opening doors,
Hoping you'll walk through
And save me boy,
Because I'm too crazy for you.
Crazy for you Everybody tells me it's 'bout time that I moved on
And I need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young
But my heart is a valley, it's so shallow and man made
I'm scared to death if I let you in that you'll see I'm just a fake
Sometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch
But I know that's just me, 'cause nothing ever is enough
When I was a child I grew up by the River Lea
There was something in the water, now that something's in me
Oh I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river But it's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain But it's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea I should probably tell you now before it's way too late
That I never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face
Consider this my apology, I know it's years in advance
But I'd rather say it now in case I never get the chance
No, I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river But it's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain It's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea I never woulda hitch-hiked to Birmingham
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda caught the train to Louisiana
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda run through the blindin' rain
Without one dollar to my name
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love I never woulda seen the trouble that I'm in
If it hadn't been for love
Woulda been gone like a wayward wind
If it hadn't been for love
Nobody knows it better than me
I wouldn't be wishing I was free
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love Four cold walls against my will
At least I know he's lying still
Four cold walls without parole
Lord have mercy on my soul Four cold walls against my will
At least I know he's lying still
Four cold walls without parole
Lord have mercy on my soul I never woulda hitch-hiked to Birmingham
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda caught the train to Louisiana
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda loaded up a forty-four
Put myself behind a jailhouse door
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love, yes
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love, yes Hold my hand while you cut me down
It had only just begun but now it's over now
And you're in the heat of moments with your heart playing up cold
I'm between the middle watching hastiness unfold
On my eyes you were smiling in the spotlight dancing with the night
The night
When I fell off your mind I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Oy, I'm tired Where'd you go when you stayed behind
I looked up and inside down and outside only to find
A double taking punching hard and laughing at my smile
I get closer you obviously prefer her I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Oy, I'm tired (I should have known) Never mind said your open arms
I couldn't help believe they tricked me back into them, even though I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Oy, I'm tired Who wants to be right as rain
It's better when something is wrong
You get excitement in your bones
And everything you do's a game
When night comes and you're on your own
You can say I chose to be alone
Who wants to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top 'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love Who wants to be riding high
When you'll just crumble back on down
You give up everything you are
And even then you don't get far
They make believe that everything
Is exactly what it seems
But at least when you're at your worst
You know how to feel things 'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love Go ahead and still my heart
To make me cry again
'Cause it will never hurt
As much as it did then
We were both right
And no one had blame
But now I give up
On this endless game 'Cause who wants to be right as rain
It's better when something is wrong
I get excitement in my bones
Even though everything's a strain
When night comes and I'm on my own
You should know I chose to be alone
Who wants to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top 'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love No room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love So little to say but so much time
Despite my empty mouth the words are in my mind
Please wear the face, the one where you smile
Because you lighten up my heart when I start to cry Forgive me first love, but I'm tired
I need to get away to feel again
Try to understand why, don't get so close to change my mind
Please wipe that look out of your eyes, it's bribing me to doubt myself
Simply, it's tiring This love has dried up and stayed behind
And if I stay I'll be alive
Then choke on words I'd always hide
Excuse me first love, but we're through
I need to taste the kiss from someone new Forgive me first love, but I'm too tired
I'm bored to say the least and I, I lack desire
Forgive me first love, forgive me first love, forgive me first love
Forgive me first love forgive me, forgive me first love, forgive me first love This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the earth move and then
Hear my heart burst again For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen Let the skyfall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together Let the skyfall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall
At skyfall Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number, you can take my name
But you'll never have my heart Let the skyfall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together Let the skyfall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together
At skyfall [x2:]
(Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall) Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me
Without the security
Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand Let the skyfall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together Let the skyfall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together
At skyfall Let the sky fall
We will stand tall
At skyfall This is how the story went
I met someone by accident
It blew me away
Blew me away It was in the darkest of my days
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
And buried them away, you buried them away I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away Dropped you off at the train station
Put a kiss on top of your head
Watch you wave
And watched you wave Then I went on home to my skyscrapers
And neon lights and waiting papers
That I call home
I call that home I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away, away Woke up feeling heavy-hearted
I'm going back to where I started
The morning rain, the morning rain
And though I wish that you were here
On that same old road that brought me here
It's calling me home, It's calling me home I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away
I can't spend my whole life hiding my heart away Right under my feet there's air made of bricks
Pulls me down turns me weak for you
I find myself repeating like a broken tune
And I'm forever excusing your intentions
That I give in to my pretendings
Which forgive you each time
Without me knowing
They melt my heart to stone And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love Each and every time I turn around to leave
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
So desperately I try to link it with my head
But instead I fall back to my knees
As you tear your way right through me
I forgive you once again
Without me knowing
You've burnt my heart to stone And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love Why do you steal my hand
Whenever I'm standing my own ground
You build me up, then leave me dead I hear your words you made up
I say your name like there should be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one, in love
I'm the only one in love Fool that I am for falling in love with you
And fool that I am for thinking you loved me too You took my heart then played the part of little coquette
And my dreams just disappeared like the smoke from a cigarette Fool that I am for hoping you'd understand
And thinking you would listen to all of the things
The things I had planned But we couldn't see eye to eye
So darling
Darling
Darling this is goodbye Oh
I still care
Fool that I am
Ooh
I still care
Fool that I am You say it's all in my head
And the things I think just don't make sense
So where you been then? Don't go all coy
Don't turn it round on me like it's my fault
See I can see that look in your eyes
The one that shoots me each and every time You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her These days when I see you
You make it look like I'm see-through
Do tell me why you waste our time
When your heart ain't in it, and you're not satisfied
You know I know just how you feel
I'm starting to find myself feeling that way too When you grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her Time and time again, I play the role of fool
(Just for you)
Even in the daylight when you think that
(I don't see you)
Try to look for things I hear but our eyes never find
Though I do know how you play You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her [Adele]
Why do you love me
Do you love me...?
Why do you love me
Do you love me?
Why do you love me
Do you love me? Why do you love me...? Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me? Why do you love me?
There must be something in the water
Cause baby I'm in deeper than I knew
How do you keep me coming back for more
After all we've been through
I can't decide if I should run and hide It's above and beyond me
It's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy
It's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me... Who knows why I love you
It could be something in the air I breath
Whatever it is, I depend on it
Where does the time go?
I spend every single moment daydreaming of you
I can't describe how I feel, it feels right It's above and beyond me
It's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy
It's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me You were a shock in the dark that blew me away
And you left your mark and it never will fade
You ignited a spark, let the fires away
Are you ready, ready?
You have a place in my heart that will always be yours
You are the peak and art of my universe
Every piece and part, you were the first
I am ready, ready It's above and beyond me,
It's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you It's above and beyond me,
It's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me... Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me? You said I'm stubborn and I never give in
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that
I think you're giving out in way too much in fact
I say we've only known each other a year
You say I've known you longer my dear
You like to be so close, I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
Walking with each other,
Think we'll never match at all, but we do
But we do, but we do, but we do I thought I knew myself, somehow you know me more
I've never known this, never before
You're the first to make up whenever we argue
I don't know who I'd be if I didn't know you
You're so provocative, I'm so conservative
You're so adventurous, I'm so very cautious, combining
You think we would and we do,
But we do, but we do, but we do Favoritism ain't my thing but,
In this situation I'll be glad Favoritism ain't my thing but,
In this situation I'll be glad to make an exception You said I'm stubborn and I never give in
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that
I think you're giving out in way too much in fact
I say we've only known each other one year
You say I've known you longer my dear
You like to be so close, I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
Walking with each other,
Think we'll never match at all, but we do In the darkness of my heart is a shadow of your face
From the deepest part of my regret
I hear the words I wish I'd said
At the dawning of the day
I can't wait to see the light
Make up memories in my head
They help to fill the emptiness you've left
I can't drown in your tears
I won't face your fears
I need to fight my own
You'll never see me again oh baby in time
Let the weight take me under
I know I'll survive
You'll never see me again At the dawning of the day
I can't bare to see the light
Make up memories in my head
They help to fill the emptiness you've left
I can't drown in your tears
I won't face your fears
I need to fight my own
You'll never see me again oh baby in time
Let the weight take me under
I know I'll survive Let the floor beneath of me fall
Let the sky come crashing down
Turn all my right to wrong
But after you that goes on
You'll never see me again
I've been learning to live without you
It's taken all of my stake
But I'm stronger now You'll never see me again oh baby in time
Let the weight take me under
I know I'll survive Let the floor beneath of me fall
Let the sky come crashing down
Turn all my right to wrong
But after you that goes on
You'll never see me again
You'll never see me again
You'll never see me again I want to see your face in every kind of light
In fields of dawn and forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make What are you doing the rest of your life?
North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me I want to see your face in every kind of light
In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes
In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes
It may take a kiss or two Through all of my life
Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall of my life
All I ever will recall of my life
Is all of my life with you Wait, do you see my heart on my sleeve?
It's been there for days on end and
It's been waiting for you to open up
Yours too baby, come on now
I'm trying to tell you just how
I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally
Say that it's always been me That's made you feel the way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last
Like I'm the one for you You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me
Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me Why is it every time I think I've tried my hardest
It turns out it ain't enough
You're still not mentioning love
What am I supposed to do to make you want me properly?
I'm taking these chances and getting nowhere
And though I'm trying my hardest you go back to her
And I think that I know things may never change
I'm still hoping one day I might hear you say I make you feel the way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last
Like I'm the one for you You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me
Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me But, despite the truth that I know
I find it hard to let go and give up on you
Seems I love the things you do
Like the meaner you treat me the more eager I am
To persist with this heartbreak and running around
And I will do until I'm finding myself you And make you feel a way you've never felt before
And be all you need so that you never want more
And you'll say all of the right things without a clue
And you'll be the one for me and me the one for you I let it fall, my heart,
And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands, they're strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,
Your name When I lay with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together nothing gets better 'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name,
Your name I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Well, it felt something died
'Cause I knew that that was
The last time, the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door,
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,
Your name I set fire to the rain,
And I threw us into the flames
Well, it felt something died
'Cause I knew that, that was the last time
The last time Let it burn
Let it burn
Let it burn [Adele]
I would never lie to you unless you tell me to...
Every part of me
All my words to hold
And hold against me
Why won't you let it be? Don't you ever say my love opened up your heart
No I'm not gonna do it standing up
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby
Won't you turn off the lights Lay me down
'til the morning!
Lay me down (through the night)
Lay me down (I can fall in)
Lay me down (Won't you)
Lay me down (I can baby)
Lay me down (Someone believe me) I would never break the rules unless you tell me to
You can read my mind, be it truth or lies
Lie down beside me, why won't you let it be? Don't you ever say my love opened up your heart
No I'm not gonna do it standing up
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights Lay me down ('til the morning)
Lay me down (through the night)
Lay me down (I can fall in)
Lay me down (Won't you)
Lay me down (I can baby)
Lay me down (Someone believe me) Lay down with me
Lay down with me
Lay down with me
Lay down with me Words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights Lay me down ('til the morning)
Lay me down (through the night)
Lay me down (I can fall in)
Lay me down (Won't you)
Lay me down (I can baby)
Lay me down
Someone believe me Never been a girl who used to cry
Didn`t show emotions, don`t know why
Didn`t wanna feel the pain inside, I guess But as the years keep going by,
you came along and changed my mind
I should leave the past behind me,
I should let you find me,
supposed to stay beside me
You were supposed to guide me,
through the ups and downs,
you were always gonna be around until the end I still think we could
`cause you and me, we`re good
And I`ll tell you why this hurts, 'cause I`m sober But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has put me through
Even when I've had too much,
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough So I pour myself another drink
whenever I start to think about you
`cause I do but I really don`t want to
but sometimes my dreams just come through And when I get there,
to a place where I see you in a kitchen
I start wishing for that thing and I don`t need you,
I don`t really wanna see you
and I don`t want you to see me,
you would think that I was crazy,
you might think that I wanna be close to you
but I`d rather wanna drink some Whisky
and maybe have a little sip `o wine
`cause right now it`s the only thing that makes me forget you were mine
but right now I am sober But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has put me through
Even when I've had too much,
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough I still think we could
(I`m not drunk enough)
`cause you and me, we`re good
`cause I`m sober But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has put me through
Even when I've had too much,
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough (I still think we could)
But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has put me through
(`cause you and me we`re good)
Even when I've had too much,
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough Think I've had enough
I must my way
I've fallen off the edge to find that I've gone blind
You're leading me astray
You haunt me like a ghost
And that scares me the most
There you are the devil on my shoulder
Smiling as the flames are growing colder
How can I believer what I have?
For a little confidence I'll grab But when my hand goes out don't take it for I'm trying to make it on my own
I fell it in my bones any minute now!
This train of thought will leave the statio
My impatience will come out to play
You've turned out to be the only face I see!
Running through the empty hallways I can tell that I am not alone You spin a web in every room
You spin a web in every room
And try to break the backbone that I've grown
Will I make my own path or wander where I'm thrown
Will I make my own path or wander where I'm thrown
Or wander where I'm thrown? When we used
To say goodnight
I'd always kiss
And hold you tight
But lately
You don't seem
To care
You close the door
And leave me
Standing there
Oh, honey
That's not fair
That's it
I quit
I'm movin' on The other night
We had a date
An you showed up
Two hours late
And though your hair
Was all in place
Somebody smeared
Their lipstick
On your face
Oh, they smeared it
Every place
Ye that's it honey
I quit I'm movin' on [Chorus]
You made me want you
You made me leave you
You made me tumble
And fall
But if I
Can't have you the way
I want you
I don't want you at all Baby, I can take a lot
'Cause I love
Everything you got
Though your kisses
Fill me
So if you got
Someone else
I gotta go
Oh, that you know
Ye that's it honey
I quit I'm movin' on [Chorus] Baby
I can take a lot
'Cause I love
Everything you got
Though your kisses
Fill me
So if you got
Someone else
I gotta go
Oh, that you know
So that's it baby
I quit I'm movin' on
Ye that's it baby
I quit now
I'm movin' on Don't ask me
What you know is true
Don't have to tell you
I love your precious heart I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never tear us apart We could live
For a thousand years
But if I hurt you
I'd make wine from your tears I told you
That we could fly
'Cause we all have wings
But some of us don't know why I
I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never ever tear us apart I know sometimes you're scared of the light
But how will you ever know if you never try
There's something new inside my heart
And it grabs like a child whenever we're apart
I see your face under every sky
I find the less I look, more I find
So let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want You know sometimes that I'm scared of the dark
But I'm feeling sun babe when I'm in your arms
You said my name in the dead of glory
You hold me alright
When I'm short of falling So let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want There will be times
When we'll try to give it up
Bursting out, it seems no doubt that will almost fall apart than burn to pieces
And we'll watch them turn to dust
But without each other, nothing is easy enough So let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
'cause you're the only one I want, yeah
You're the only one
Never gonna leave you
No, I'm never gonna leave you, no Go ahead, go ahead and smash it on the floor
Take whatever is left, and take it with you out the door
See if I cry
See if I shed a single sorry tear
Can't say that it's been that great
No in fact it's been a wasted worried year [Chorus]
Everybody sees
And everyone agrees
That you and I are wrong
And it's been that way to long
Take it as it comes
And be thankful when it's done
There's so many ways to act
And there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black Let it out, let it all out
Say what's on your mind
You can kick and scream and shout and say things that are so unkind
Yeah-see if I care, see if I stand firm or if I fall
Cause in the back of my mind, and on the tip of my tongue
Is the answer to it all [Chorus] Yeah there's many shades of black [Chorus] Cause there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
Yeah there's any shades of black
There's so many shades of black
Yeah there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
And there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black Go ahead... Last night she said
Oh, baby
I feel so down
Oh, and turned me off
When I feel left out
So I
I turned around
Oh, baby
I don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking
Out that door Well, I've been in town
For just about fifteen
Whole minutes now
Oh, baby, I feel so down
And I don't know why
I keep walking for miles But the people
They don't understand
No, girlfriends
They can't understand
Your grandsons
They won't understand
On top of this
I ain't ever
Gonna understand Last night she said
Oh, baby
Don't feel so down
Oh, and turned me off
When I feel left out
So I, I turned around
Oh, baby
I'm gonna be alright
It was a great big lie
Cuz I left that night
Yeah Oh, people
They don't understand
No, girlfriends
They don't understand
In spaceships
They won't understand
And me
I ain't ever
Gonna understand Last night she said
Oh, baby
I feel so down
She had turned me off
When I feel left out
So I
I turned around
Oh, little girl
I don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking
Out that door, yeah Painting pictures with my mind
Making memories using my eyes
Filling up my heart with golden stories
Who adds some spice to the rhythm of life, oh Welcome sunrise with the morning glory
I've changed my mind
There is no simple
I thought of me, I want to see
I want to feel my heartbeat so
With the world that you feel, leave I can feel the pressure pushing onto my heart
And it's teasing me
To scratch my itch and beat my drum
So I can start to begin what's begun Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories Running riots inside my soul
Fire burning and it's lighting me up
To scratch my itch and beat my drum
So I can finish what has begun Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories Sometimes the hole you left hurts
My heart so bad, it cuts through
The deepest parts of me and fills up my mouth with the words that cry
Out, I'm still trying to stay inside Hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts Our hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts Every now and then my memories ache
With empty ideas of the ones we'd have made it
But as time goes on and my age gets older
I love the ones I know, they're enough to picture the rest 'Cause heart break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts Our hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts You know when to make me, imagine you're here
You know when to make me, imagine you're here
You know when to make me, imagine you're here
You know when to make me, imagine you're here Find yourself a girl
And settle down
Live a simple life
In a quiet town Steady as she goes
(Steady as she goes)
Steady as she goes
(Steady as she goes) So steady as she goes Your friends have shown
A kink
In the single life
You've had
Too much to think
Now you need a wife Steady as she goes
(Steady as she goes)
So steady as she goes
(Steady as she goes) Well here we go again
You've found yourself
A friend
That knows you well
But no matter
What you do
You'll always feel
As though you
Tripped and fell So steady as she goes When you have completed
What you thought
You had to do
And your blood's
Depleted
To the point
Of stable glue Then you'll get along
Then you'll get along Steady as she goes
(Steady as she goes)
So steady as she goes
(Steady as she goes) Well here we go again
You've found yourself
A friend
That knows you well
But no matter
What you do
You'll always feel
As though you
Tripped and fell So steady as she goes
Steady as she goes Settle for a girl
(Settle for a girl)
Neither up or down
(Neither up or down)
Sell it to the crowd
(Sell it to the crowd)
That is gathered round
(That is gathered round) Settle for a girl
(Settle for a girl)
Neither up or down
(Neither up or down)
Sell it to the crowd
(Sell it to the crowd)
That is gathered round
(That is gathered round) So steady as she goes
(Steady as she goes)
Steady as she goes
(Steady as she goes) Steady as she goes
(Steady as she goes)
So steady as she goes
(Steady as she goes) Steady as she go
Are you steady now?
Steady as she goes
Are you steady now? Steady as she goes
Are you steady now?
Steady as she goes
Are you steady now? Steady as she goes I'm insane in the brain
You're not already...
Feel the pain running through my veins
Don't you piss me off, pretentious, ostentatious
Other words are spring to me
... emolicious, for the shoot posses no... And you want me to respect you
And have... for yourself
You're out of control with nobody around to help
Help, help oh oh. Chorus:
This time you're on your own
Running back to mommy hoping that she's home
But if she's not there and you're on your alone
So... you then go calling
Call it a fiasco, call it a fiasco, fiasco
... fiasco, fiasco,... fiasco
1 2 3 4.
Hustle...
Wanna try to testify in a... of happiness
Be the best, have success,
Doesn't mean you're Hollywood Feel blessed not impressed
By the glamour if you think you could. And you want me to respect you
And have... for yourself
You're out of control with nobody around to help
Help, help oh oh. Chorus:
This time you're on your own
Running about the mammy hoping that she's home
But if she's not there and you're on your alone
So... you then go calling
Fiasco, call it fiasco, fiasco
... fiasco, fiasco,... fiasco
1 2 3 4. Fiasco, fiasco [Chorus:]
1 2 3 4
I'm calling, I'm calling, I'm calling it fiasco,
I'm calling, I'm calling, I'm calling it fiasco,
I'm calling, I'm calling, I'm calling it fiasco. 
I. LIFE.
When somebody loved me
Everything was beautiful
Every hour we spent together
Lives within my heart And when she was sad
I was there to dry her tears
And when she was happy so was I
When she loved me Through the summer and the fall
We had each other that was all
Just she and I together
Like it was meant to be And when she was lonely
I was there to comfort her
And I knew that she loved me So the years went by
I stayed the same
She began to drift away
I was left alone Still I waited for the day
When she'd say
I will always love you Lonely and forgotten
Never thought she'd look my way
She smiled at me and held me Just like she used to do
Like she loved me
When she loved me When somebody loved me
Everything was beautiful
Every hour we spent together
Lives within my heart When she loved me, hey Sentimentos são
Fáceis de mudar
Mesmo entre quem
Não vê que alguém
Pode ser seu par Basta um olhar
Que o outro não espera
Para assustar e até perturbar
Mesmo a bela e a fera Sentimento assim
Sempre é uma surpresa
Quando ele vem
Nada o detém
É uma chama acesa Sentimentos vêm
Para nos trazer
Novas sensações
Doces emoções
E um novo prazer E numa estação
Como a primavera
Sentimentos são
Como uma canção
Para a bela e a fera Sentimentos são
Como uma canção
Para a bela e a fera Para a bela e a fera Tale as old as time
True as it can be
Barely even friends
Then somebody bends
Unexpectedly. Just a little change
Small to say the least
Both a little scared
Neither one prepared
Beauty and the Beast Ever just the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before
Ever just as sure
As the sun will rise Tale as old as time
Tune as old as song
Bittersweet and strange
Finding you can change
Learning you were wrong Certain as the sun
Rising in the east
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast Look at this stuff, isn't it neat?
Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?
Wouldn't you think I'm the girl
The girl who has everything?
Look at this trove, treasures untold
How many wonders can one cavern hold?
Lookin' around here you'd think
Sure, she's got everything I've got gadgets and gizmos aplenty
I've got whooz-its and whatz-its galore
You want thingamabobs?
I got twenty
But who cares?
No big deal
I want more I want to be where the people are
I want to see
Want to see 'em dancing
Walking around on those
Whadd'ya call 'em? Oh, feet
Flipping your fins you don't get too far
Legs are required for jumping, dancing
Strolling along down a
What's that word again? Street Up where they walk
Up where they run
Up where they stay all day in the sun
Wandering free
Wish I could be
Part of that world What would I give
If I could live
Out of these waters?
What would I pay
To spend a day
Warm on the sand?
Betcha on land
They understand
That they don't reprimand their daughters
Bright young women
Sick of swimming
Ready to stand And I'm ready to know what the people know
Ask 'em my questions
And get some answers
What's a fire and why does it
What's the word? Burn? When's it my turn?
Wouldn't I love
Love to explore that shore above?
Out of the sea
Wish I could be
Part of that world
Out of the sea
Wish I could be
Part of your world You think I'm an ignorant savage
And you've been so many places
I guess it must be so
But still I cannot see
If the savage one is me
How can there be so much that you don't know
You don't know You think you own whatever land you land on
The Earth is just a dead thing you can claim
But I know every rock and tree and creature
Has a life, has a spirit, has a name You think the only people who are people
Are the people who look and think like you
But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger
You'll learn things you never knew, you never knew Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountains
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest
Come taste the sun sweet berries of the Earth
Come roll in all the riches all around you
And for once, never wonder what they're worth The rainstorm and the river are my brothers
The heron and the otter are my friends
And we are all connected to each other
In a circle, in a hoop that never ends How high will the sycamore grow
If you cut it down, then you'll never know
And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
For whether we are white or copper skinned
We need to sing with all the voices of the mountains
We need to paint with all the colors of the wind You can own the Earth and still
All you'll own is Earth until
You can paint with all the colors of the wind It's a small world, it's a small world
It's a small world, it's a small world It's a world of laughter, a world of tears
It's a world of hope and a world of fears
There's so much that we share, that it's time we're aware
It's a small world after all (Everybody now) it's a small world after all, it's a small world after all
(Everybody now) it's a small world after all, it's a small, small, small, small world There is just one moon and one golden sun
And a smile means friendship to everyone
Though the mountains be wide and the oceans are wide
It's a small world after all (Come on, come on) (Everybody now) it's a small world after all (can you hear me now) it's a small world after all
(Everybody now) it's a small world after all, it's a small, small, small, small world It's a small world after all, no matter if you're big or small
Come on everybody let's bounce to this
Let's play some love with a little twist
It's a small world, it's a small world It's a world of laughter, a world of tears
It's a world of hope and a world of fears
There's so much that we share, that it's time we're aware
It's a small world after all, it's a small world (Everybody now) it's a small world after all, it's a small world after all
(Everybody now) it's a small world after all, it's a small, small, small, small world (can you hear me now?) It's a small world after all (come on, come on)
It's a small, small, small, small world (come on, come on)
It's a small world, after all (can you hear me now?) It's a small world after all (come on, come on)
It's a small world after all
It's a small, small, small, small world (pretty small eh) It's a small world after all, it's a small world after all
It's a small world after all, it's a small, small, small, small world
It's a small world after all, it's a small world after all
It's a small world after all, it's a small, small, small, small world A dream is a wish your heart makes
When you're fast asleep
In dreams you will loose your heartache
Whatever you wish for, you keep Have faith in your dreams and someday
Your rainbow will come smiling through
No matter how your heart is grieving
If you keep on believing
The dream that you wish will come true Oh, that clock!
Oh, killjoy
I hear you, come on, get up you say
Time to start another day
Even he orders me around
Well, there's one thing
They can't order me to stop dreaming
And perhaps someday
The dreams that I wish will come true No matter how your heart is grieving
If you keep on believing
The dream that you wish will come true I've been staring at the edge of the water
Long as I can remember
Never really knowing why
I wish I could be the perfect daughter
But I come back to the water
No matter how hard I try Every turn I take
Every trail I track
Every path I make
Every road leads back to the place I know
Where I cannot go
Where I long to be See the line where the sky meets the sea
It calls me
And no one knows how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know
If I go there's just no telling how far I'll go I know everybody on this island
Seems so happy on this island
Everything is by design
I know everybody on this island
Has a role on this island
So maybe I can roll with mine I can lead with pride
I can make us strong
I'll be satisfied if I play along
But the voice inside sings a different song
What is wrong with me See the light as it shines on the sea
It's blinding
But no one knows how deep it goes
And it seems like it's calling out to me
So come find me
And let me know
What's beyond that line
Will I cross that line The line where the sky meets the sea
It calls me
And no one knows how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know
How far I'll go Look at me
I will never pass for a perfect bride
Or a perfect daughter
Can it be
I'm not meant to play this part?
Now I see
That if I were truly to be myself
I would break my fam'ly's heart Who is that girl I see
Staring straight
Back at me?
Why is my reflection someone
I don't know?
Somehow I cannot hide
Who I am
Though I've tried
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside?
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside? When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires
Will come to you
If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind
She brings to those to love
The sweet fulfillment of
Their secret longing
Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true Belle:
There's something sweet and almost kind
But he was mean and he was coarse and unrefined
And now he's dear and so unsure
I wonder why I didn't see it there before Beast:
She glanced this way, I thought I saw
And when we touched she didn't shudder at my paw
No it can't be, I'll just ignore
But then she's never looked at me that way before Belle:
New and a bit alarming
Who'd have ever thought that this could be?
True that he's no Prince Charming
But there's something in him that I simply didn't see Lumiere:
Well, who'd have thought? Mrs Potts:
Well, bless my soul Cogsworth:
Well, who'd have known? Mrs Potts:
Well, who indeed? Lumiere:
And who'd have guessed they'd come together on their own? Mrs Potts:
It's so peculiar,
Wait and see. All three:
We'll wait and see
A few days more
There may be something there that wasn't there before Cogsworth:
Well here's a thought, perhaps there's something there that wasn't there before Chip:
What mama? Mrs Potts:
There may be something there that wasn't there before If there's a prize for rotten judgment
I guess I've already won that
No man is worth the aggravation
That's ancient history, been there, done that
Who d'you think you're kidding
He's the earth and heaven to you
Try to keep it hidden
Honey we can see right through you (Oh no)
Girl, you can't conceal it
We know how you're feeling
Who you thinking of?
No chance, no way, I won't say it, no, no
You swoon, you sigh, why deny it, oh, oh
It's too cliché, I won't say I'm in love
I thought my heart had learned its lesson
It feels so good when you start out
My head is screaming "get a grip, girl"
"Unless you're dying to cry your heart out"
Girl, you can't deny it
Who you are and how you're feeling
Baby we're not buying
Hon we saw you hit the ceiling
Face it like a grown-up
When you gonna own up that you got, got, got it bad?
No chance, no way, I won't say it, no no
Give up, give in, check the grin, you're in love
This scene won't play, I won't say I'm in love
We'll do it until you admit you're in love
You're way off base, I won't say it
Get off my case, I won't say it
Girl don't be proud, it's okay you're in love
At least out loud I won't say I'm in love Tale as old as time
True as it can be
Barely even friends
Then somebody bends
Unexpectedly. Just a little change

Both a little scared
Neither one prepared

Ever a surprise

Beauty and the Beast Little town
It's a quiet village
Every day
Like the one before
Little town
Full of little people
Waking up to say Bonjour
Bonjour
Bonjour Bonjour Bonjour There goes the baker with his tray, like always
The same old bread and rolls to sell
Every morning just the same
Since the morning that we came
To this poor provincial town
Good Morning, Belle
'Morning, Monsieur
Where are you off to
The bookshop. I just finished the most wonderful story
about a beanstalk and an ogre and a
That's nice. Marie, the baguettes hurry up Look there she goes that girl is strange, no question
Dazed and distracted, can't you tell
Never part of any crowd
'Cause her head's up on some cloud
No denying she's a funny girl that Belle Bonjour
Good day
How is your family Bonjour
Good day
How is your wife I need six eggs
That's too expensive There must be more than this provincial life Ah, Belle
Good Morning. I've come to return the book I borrowed
Finished already
Oh, I couldn't put it down. Have you got anything new
Ha Ha! Not since yesterday
That's all right. I'll borrow, this one
That one? But you've read it twice
Well, it's my favorite! Far off places, daring sword fights
magic spells, a prince in disguise
If you like it all that much, it's yours
But sir
I insist
Well, thank you. Thank you very much Look there she goes that girl is so peculiar
I wonder if she's feeling well
With a dreamy far-off look
And her nose stuck in a book
What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle Oh, isn't this amazing?
It's my favorite part because you'll see
Here's where she meets Prince Charming
But she won't discover that it's him 'til chapter three Now it's no wonder that her name means "beauty"
Her looks have got no parallel
But behind that fair facade
I'm afraid she's rather odd
Very diff'rent from the rest of us
She's nothing like the rest of us
Yes, diff'rent from the rest of us is Belle Wow! You didn't miss a shot, Gaston, You're the greatest
hunter in the whole world!
I know.
No beast alive stands a chance against you. Ha ha ha and
no girl, for that matter.
It's true, LeFou. And I've got my sights set on that one
Hmm the inventor's daughter
She's the one - the lucky girl I'm going to marry
But she's
The most beautiful girl in town.
I know, but
That makes her the best. And don't I deserve the best
Well, of course! I mean you do, but Right from the moment when I met her, saw her
I said she's gorgeous and I fell
Here in town there's only she
Who is beautiful as me
So I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle Look there he goes
Isn't he dreamy
Monsieur Gaston
Oh he's so cute
Be still my heart
I'm hardly breathing
He's such a tall, dark, strong and handsome brute Bonjour
Pardon
Good day
Mais oui
You call this bacon
What lovely grapes
Some cheese
Ten yards
One pound
'Scuse me
I'll get the knife
Please let me through
This bread
Those fish
It's stale
They smell
Madame's mistaken There must be more than this provincial life
Just watch, I'm going to make Belle my wife Look there she goes a girl who's strange but special
A most peculiar mademoiselle
It's a pity and a sin
She doesn't quite fit in
'Cause she really is a funny girl
A beauty but a funny girl
She really is a funny girl
That Belle Master, I don't think you quite realize what you got here!
So, why don't you just ruminate,
Whilst I illuminate the possibilities! Well, Ali Baba had them forty thieves,
Scheherazade had a thousand tales.
But master you're in luck, 'cause up your sleeves
You've got a brand of magic never fails You've got some power in your corner now!
Some heavy ammunition in your camp!
You got some punch, pizzaz, yahoo and how...
See, all you gotta do is rub that lamp, and I'll say: Chorus:
"Mr. Aladdin, sir, what will your pleasure be?
Let me take your order, jot it down?"
You ain't never had friend like me Life is your restaurant and I'm your maitre'd
Come on whisper what it is you want;
You ain't never had friend like me! Yes sir, we pride ourselves on service.
You're the boss, the king, the shah.
Say what you wish; it's yours, true dish.
How 'bout a little more baklava? Have some of column A try All of column B,
I'm in the mood to help you, dude.
You ain't never had friend like me Oh my. No no. My my my.
Can your friends do this?
Can your friends do that?
Can your friends pull this
Out their little hat?
Can your friends go poof?
Well looky here!
Can your friends go abracadabra, let her rip,
And then make the sucker disappear? So don't just sit there slack-jawed, buggy-eyed,
I'm here to answer all your midnight prayers,
You've got me bona fide certified;
You've got a genie for charge d'affaires. I've got a powerful urge to help you out,
So what you wish, I really wanna know?
You've got a list that's three miles long, no doubt,
Well all you've gotta do is rub like so, and oh ­- Mr. Aladdin, sir, have a wish or two or three.
I'm on the job you big nabob!
You ain't never had a friend, never had a friend,
You ain't never had a friend, never had a friend,
You ain't never had a friend like me.
You ain't never had a friend like me The seaweed is always greener
In somebody else's lake
You dream about going up there
But that is a big mistake
Just look at the world around you
Right here on the ocean floor
Such wonderful things surround you
What more is you lookin' for? Under the sea
Under the sea
Darling it's better
Down where it's wetter
Take it from me
Up on the shore they work all day
Out in the sun they slave away
While we devotin'
Full time to floatin'
Under the sea Down here all the fish is happy
As off through the waves they roll
The fish on the land ain't happy
They sad 'cause they in their bowl
But fish in the bowl is lucky
They in for a worser fate
One day when the boss get hungry
Guess who's gon' be on the plate? Under the sea
Under the sea
Nobody beat us
Fry us and eat us
In fricassee
We what the land folks loves to cook
Under the sea we off the hook
We got no troubles
Life is the bubbles
Under the sea (Under the sea)
Under the sea (Under the sea) Since life is sweet here
We got the beat here
Naturally (Naturally)
Even the sturgeon an' the ray
They get the urge 'n' start to play
We got the spirit
You got to hear it
Under the sea The newt play the flute
The carp play the harp
The plaice play the bass
And they soundin' sharp
The bass play the brass
The chub play the tub
The fluke is the duke of soul
(Yeah)
The ray he can play
The lings on the strings
The trout rockin' out
The blackfish she sings
The smelt and the sprat
They know where it's at
An' oh that blowfish blow Yeah, under the sea (Under the sea)
Under the sea (Under the sea)
When the sardine
Begin the beguine
It's music to me (It's music to me)
What do they got? A lot of sand
We got a hot crustacean band
Each little clam here
Know how to jam here
Under the sea
Each little slug here
Cuttin' a rug here
Under the sea
Each little snail here
Know how to wail here
That's why it's hotter
Under the water
Ya we in luck here
Down in the muck here
Under the sea [Gramma Tala:]
I know a girl from an island
She stands apart from the crowd
She loves the sea and her people
She makes her whole family proud
Sometimes the world seems against you
The journey may leave a scar
But scars can heal and reveal just
Where you are The people you love will change you
The things you have learned will guide you
And nothing on earth can silence
The quiet voice still inside you
And when that voice starts to whisper
Moana you've come so far
Moana listen
Do you know who you are? [Moana:]
Who am I?
I am a girl who loves my island
I'm the girl who loves the sea
It calls me
I am the daughter of the village chief
We are descended from voyagers
Who found their way across the world
They call me
I've delivered us to where we are
I have journeyed farther
I am everything I've learned and more
Still it calls me
And the call isn't out there at all, it's inside me
It's like the tide; always falling and rising
I will carry you here in my heart you'll remind me
That come what may
I know the way
I am Moana! The only way to get what you want is to become a human yourself
Can you do that? My dear, sweet child, that's what I do
It's what I live for
To help unfortunate merfolk like yourself
Poor souls with no one else to turn to I admit that in the past I've been a nasty
They weren't kidding when they called me, well, a witch
But you'll find that nowadays
I've mended all my ways
Repented, seen the light, and made a switch
To this
And I fortunately know a little magic
It's a talent that I always have possessed
And dear lady, please don't laugh
I use it on behalf
Of the miserable, the lonely, and depressed (Pathetic) Poor unfortunate souls
In pain, in need
This one longing to be thinner
That one wants to get the girl
And do I help them?
Yes, indeed
Those poor unfortunate souls
So sad, so true
They come flocking to my cauldron
Crying, "Spells, Ursula, please!"
And I help them
Yes I do Now it's happened once or twice
Someone couldn't pay the price
And I'm afraid I had to rake 'em 'cross the coals
Yes I've had the odd complaint
But on the whole I've been a saint
To those poor unfortunate souls Have we got a deal?
If I become human, I'll never be with my father or sisters again
But you'll have your man
Life's full of tough choices, isn't it?
Oh, and there is one more thing
We haven't discussed the subject of payment
But I don't have-
I'm not asking much, just a token really, a trifle
What I want from you is your voice
But without my voice, how can I-
You'll have your looks, your pretty face
And don't underestimate the importance of body language, ha! The men up there don't like a lot of blabber
They think a girl who gossips is a bore
Yet on land it's much preferred for ladies not to say a word
And after all dear, what is idle babble for?
Come on, they're not all that impressed with conversation
True gentlemen avoid it when they can
But they dote and swoon and fawn
On a lady who's withdrawn
It's she who holds her tongue who gets a man Come on you poor unfortunate soul
Go ahead
Make your choice
I'm a very busy woman and I haven't got all day
It won't cost much
Just your voice!
You poor unfortunate soul
It's sad but true
If you want to cross the bridge, my sweet
You've got the pay the toll
Take a gulp and take a breath
And go ahead and sign the scroll
Flotsam, Jetsam, now I've got her, boys
The boss is on a roll
This poor unfortunate soul Beluga sevruga
Come winds of the Caspian Sea
Larengix glaucitis
Et max laryngitis
La voce to me Now, sing
Aa-aa-aah, a-aa-aah
Keep singing!
Aa-aa-aah, a-aa-aah (Spoken) Mama, I don't have time for dancing
(Sung) That's just gonna have to wait a while
Ain't got time for messing around
And it's not my style This old town can slow you down
People taking the easy way
But I know exactly where I'm going
I'm getting closer and closer everyday And I'm almost there
I'm almost there
People 'round here think I'm crazy
But I don't care Trials and tribulations
I've had my share
But there ain't nothing gonna stop me now
Cause I'm almost there I remember daddy told me
"Fairy tales can come true
But you gotta make it happen
It all depends on you" So I work real hard each and everyday
Now things for sure are going my way
Just doing what I do
Look out boys I'm coming through And I'm almost there
I'm almost there
People gonna come here from everywhere
And I'm almost there I'm almost there There's been trials and tribulations
You know I've had my share
But I've climbed a mountain, I've crossed a river
And I'm almost there I'm almost there I'm almost there I know you
I walked with you
Once Upon a dream
I know you That gleam in your eyes
Is so familiar a gleam
Yet I know it's true
That visions are seldom what they seem But if I know you
I know what you do
You'll love me at once
The way you did once upon a dream La da la da la ahahahahah
But if I know you
I know what you do
You'll love me at once The way you did once upon a dream
I know you
I walked with you
Once Upon a dream I know you
That gleam in your eyes
Is so familiar a gleam
Yet I know it's true That visions are seldom what they seem
But if I know you
I know what you do
You'll love me at once The way you did once upon a dream The King and his men
stole the queen from her bed,
and bound her in her bones.
The seas be ours, and by the powers;
where we will, we'll roam. Yo ho, all hands,
hoist the colors high.
Heave ho, thieves and beggars;
never shall we die. Now, some have died and some are alive
and others sail on the sea.
With the keys to the cage
and the devil to pay,
we lay to the fiddler's green. Yo ho haul together,
hoist the colors high.
Heave ho, thieves and beggars;
never shall we die. The bell has been raised
from its watery grave,
hear its sepulchral tone.
A call to all; pay heed the squall,
and turn your sails to home. Yo ho, haul together,
hoist the colors high.
Heave ho, thieves and beggars;
never shall we die. Yo ho, haul together,
hoist the colors high.
Heave ho, thieves and beggars;
never shall we die. Yo ho, haul together,
hoist the colors high.
Heave ho, thieves and beggars;
never shall we die. The king and his men
stole the queen from her bed,
and bound her in her bones.
The seas be ours, and by the powers;
where we will; we'll roam. So many times out there
I've watched a happy pair of lovers walking in the night
They had a kind of glow around them
It almost looked like heaven's light I knew I'd never know that warm and loving glow
Though I might wish with all my might
No face as hideous as my face
Was ever meant for heaven's light But suddenly an angel has smiled at me
And kissed my cheek without a trace of fright I dare to dream that she might even care for me
And as I ring these bells tonight
My cold dark tower seems so bright
I swear it must be Heaven's light Confiteor deo omnipotenti
(I confess to God almighty)
Beatae Mariae semper virgini
(To blessed Mary ever virgin)
Beato Michaeli archangelo
(To the blessed Archangel Michael)
Sanctis apostolis omnibus sanctis
(To the Holy Apostles, to all the saints) Beata Maria, you know I am a righteous man
Of my virtue I am justly proud
Et tibit Pater
(And to you, Father) Beata Maria, you know I'm so much purer than
The common, vulgar, weak, licentious crowd
Quia peccavi nimis
(That I have sinned) Then tell me, Maria, why I see her dancing there?
Why her smold'ring eyes still scorch my soul
Cogitatione
(In thought) I feel her, I see her, the sun caught in her raven hair
Is blazing in me out of all control
Verbo et opere
(In word and deed) Like fire, Hellfire
This fire in my skin
This burning desire
Is turning me to sin
It's not my fault Mea culpa
(Through my fault)
I'm not to blame
Mea culpa
(Through my fault) It is the gypsy girl
The witch who sent this flame
Mea maxima culpa
(Through my most grievous fault)
It's not my fault
Mea culpa
(Through my fault) If in God's plan
Mea culpa
(Through my fault)
He made the devil so much
Stronger than a man
Mea maxima culpa
(Through my most grievous fault) Protect me, Maria
Don't let this siren cast her spell
Don't let her fire sear my flesh and bone
Destroy Esmeralda
And let her taste the fires of hell
Or else let her be mine and mine alone Minister Frollo, the gypsy has escaped
What? No longer in the cathedral, she's gone
But how? Never mind, get out, you idiot
I'll find her, I'll find her if I have to burn down all of Paris Hellfire, dark fire
Now gypsy, it's your turn
Choose me or your pyre
Be mine or you will burn Kyrie Eleison
(Lord, have mercy)
God, have mercy on her
Kyrie Eleison
(Lord, have mercy) God, have mercy on me
Kyrie Eleison
(Lord, have mercy)
But she will be mine
Or she will burn I'm gonna be a mighty king
So enemies beware!
Well, I've never seen a king of beasts
With quite so little hair
I'm gonna be the mane event
Like no king was before I'm brushing up on looking down
I'm working on my ROAR
Thus far, a rather uninspiring thing
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!
(You've rather a long way to go, young master
if you think) No one saying do this
(Now when I said that, I)
No one saying be there
(What I meant was)
No one saying stop that
(Look, what you don't realize) No one saying see here
(Now see here!)
Free to run around all day
(Well, that's definitely out)
Free to do it all my way!
I think it's time that you and I Arranged a heart to heart
Kings don't need advice
From little hornbills for a start
If this is where the monarchy is headed
Count me out!
Out of service, out of Africa I wouldn't hang about
This child is getting wildly out of wing
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!
Everybody look left
Everybody look right
Everywhere you look I'm Standing in spotlight!
Not yet!
Let every creature go for broke and sing
Let's hear it in the herd and on the wing
It's gonna be King Simba's finest fling
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!
Oh, I just can't wait to be king! A word's just a word
'Til you mean what you say
And love isn't love
'Til you give it away We've all got a gift
Yeah, something to give
To make a change Send it on, on and on
Just one hand can heal another
Be a part, reach a heart
Just one spark starts a fire With one little action
The chain reaction will never stop
Make it strong
Shine a light, and send it on Just smile, and the world
Will smile along with you
That small act of love
Is meant for one who become two If we take the chances
To change circumstances
Imagine all we can do If we send it on, on and on
Just one hand can heal another
Be a part, reach a heart
Just one spark starts a fire With one little action
The chain reaction will never stop
Make it strong
Shine a light, and send it on
Send it on, ooh, send it on There's power in all
Of the choices we make
So I'm starting now
There's not a moment to waste A word's just word
'Til you mean what you say
And love isn't love
'Til you give it away Send it on, on and on
Just one hand can heal another

That's the time that they begin it
Cinderelly, Cinderelly (Cinderella!) Cinderelly, Cinderelly
Night and day it's Cinderelly
Make the fire, fix the breakfast
Wash the dishes, do the mopping
And the sweeping and the dusting
They always keep her hopping
She goes around in circles till she's very, very dizzy
Still they holler "Keep a-busy, Cinderelly!" We can do it, we can do it
We can help our Cinderelly
We can make her dress so pretty
There's nothing to it, really
We'll tie a sash around it
Put a ribbon through it
When dancing at the ball she'll be more beautiful than all
In the lovely dress we'll make for Cinderelly! Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry
Gonna help our Cinderelly
Got no time to dilly-dally
We gotta get a-goin'
I'll cut it with these scissors!
And I can do the sewing!
Leave the sewing to the women
You go get some trimmin'
And we'll make a lovely dress for Cinderelly, whoo! We'll make a lovely dress for Cinderelly! Morning in Paris, the city awakes
To the bells of Notre Dame
The fisherman fishes, the bakerman bakes
To the bells of Notre Dame
To the big bells as loud as the thunder
To the little bells soft as a psalm
And some say the soul of the city is
The toll of the bells
The bells of Notre Dame Dark was the night when our tale was begun
On the docks near Notre Dame Four frightened gypsies slid silently under
The docks near Notre Dame But a trap had been laid for the gypsies
And they gazed up in fear and alarm
At a figure whose clutches
Were iron as much as the bells The bells of Notre Dame (Kyrie Eleison)
Judge Claude Frollo longed
To purge the world
Of vice and sin
(Kyrie Eleison)
And he saw corruption
Ev'rywhere
Except within Dies irae, dies illa
(Dies irae, dies illa)
Dies irae, dies illa
(Dies irae, dies illa)
Solvet saeclum in favilla
Teste David cum sibylla
Quantus tremor est futurus
Quando Judex est venturus See there the innocent blood you have spilt
On the steps of Notre Dame Now you would add this child's blood to your guilt
On the steps of Notre Dame You can lie to yourself and your minions
You can claim that you haven't a qualm
But you never can run from
Nor hide what you've done from the eyes
The very eyes of Notre Dame (Kyrie Eleison)
And for one time in his live
Of power and control
(Kyrie Eleison)
Frollo felt a twinge of fear
For his immortal soul Just so he's kept locked away
Where no one else can see Even this foul creature may
Yet prove one day to be
Of use to me Now here is a riddle to guess if you can
Sing the bells of Notre Dame
Who is the monster and who is the man Sing the bells, bells, bells, bells
Bells, bells, bells, bells
Bells of Notre Dame I can show you the world
Shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me, princess, now when did
You last let your heart decide? I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But when I'm way up here, it's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with you
Now I'm in a whole new world with you Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky A whole new world
Don't you dare close your eyes
A hundred thousand things to see
(Hold your breath, it gets better) I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far
I can't go back
To where I used to be A whole new world
Every turn a surprise
With new horizons to pursue
Every moment red-letter I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you A whole new world
That's where we'll be
A thrilling chase
A wondrous place
For you and me Somewhere out there,
Beneath the pale moonlight,
Someone's thinking of me,
And loving me tonight. Somewhere out there,
Someone's saying a prayer,
That we'll find one another,
In that big somewhere out there. And even though I know how very far apart we are,
It helps to think we might be wishing on the same bright star,
And when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby,
It helps to think we're sleeping underneath the same big sky! Somewhere out there,
If love can see us through,
Then we'll be together,
Somewhere out there,
Out where dreams
Come true... There you see her
Sitting there across the way
She don't got a lot to say
But there's something about her
And you don't know why
But you're dying to try
You wanna kiss the girl Yes, you want her
Look at her, you know you do
Possible she wants you too
There is one way to ask her
It don't take a word
Not a single word
Go on and kiss the girl Sing with me now
Sha la la la la la
My oh my
Look like the boy too shy
Ain't gonna kiss the girl
Sha la la la la la
Ain't that sad?
Ain't it a shame?
Too bad, he gonna miss the girl Now's your moment
Floating in a blue lagoon
Boy, you better do it soon
No time will be better
She don't say a word
And she won't say a word
Until you kiss the girl Sha la la la la la
Don't be scared
You got the mood prepared
Go on and kiss the girl
Sha la la la la la
Don't stop now
Don't try to hide it how
You want to kiss the girl
Sha la la la la la
Float along
And listen to the song
The song say kiss the girl
Sha la la la la la
The music play
Do what the music say
You got to kiss the girl
You've got to kiss the girl
You wanna kiss the girl
You've gotta kiss the girl
Go on and kiss the girl Zip-a-dee-doo-dah, zip-a-dee-ay

Herc was on a roll
Person of the week in every Greek opinion poll
What a pro!
Herc could stop a show
Point him at a monster and you're talking S.R.O. He was a no one
A zero, zero
Now he a hot shot
He's a hero
He was a kid with his act down pat
From zero to hero in no time flat
Zero to hero, just like that! When he smiled the girls went wild
With oohs and ahhs
And they slapped his face on ev'ry vase
(On every vahse) From appearance fees and royalties
Our Herc had cash to burn
Now nouveau riche and famous
He could tell you what's a Grecian "earn"! Say "Amen"
There he goes again
Sweet and undefeated
And an awesome 10 for 10
Folks lined up
Just to watch him flex
And this perfect package packed a pair of pretty pecs Hercie, he comes, he sees, he conquers
Honey, the crowds were going bonkers
He showed the moxie, brains, and spunk
From zero to hero
A major hunk
Zero to hero
And who'd have thunk? Who put the "glad" in "gladiator"?
Hercules!
Whose daring deeds are great theater?
Hercules!
Is he bold?
No one braver!
Is he sweet?
Our favorite flavor! Hercules, Hercules
Hercules, Hercules
Hercules, Hercules Bless my soul
Herc was on a roll
Undefeated
Riding high
And the nicest guy
Not conceited He was a nothin'
A zero, zero
Now he's a hot-shot
He's our hero
He hit the heights at breakneck speed! From zero to hero
Herc is a hero
Now he's a hero Yes indeed! Tale as old as time
True as it can be
Barely even friends
Then somebody bends
Unexpectedly. Just a little change
Small to say the least
Both a little scared
Neither one prepared
Beauty and the Beast Ever just the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before
Ever just as sure
As the sun will rise Tale as old as time
Tune as old as song
Bittersweet and strange
Finding you can change
Learning you were wrong Certain as the sun
Rising in the east
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast Think of a wonderful thought
Any merry little thought
Think of Christmas, think of snow
Think of sleigh bells off you go
Like reindeer in the sky You can fly
You can fly
You can fly Think of the happiest things
It's the same as having wings
Take the path that moonbeams make
If the moon is still awake
You'll see him wink his eye You can fly
You can fly
You can fly Up you go with a height and ho
To the stars beyond the blue
There's a Never Land waiting for you
Where all your happy dreams come true
Every dream that you dream will come true When there's a smile in your heart
There's no better time to start
Think of all the joy you'll find
When you leave the world behind
And bid your cares goodbye You can fly
You can fly
You can fly
You can fly
You can fly When there's a smile in your heart
There's no better time to start
Think of all the joy you'll find
When you leave the world behind
And bid your cares goodbye You can fly
You can fly
You can fly
You can fly
You can fly I've been standing at the edge of the water
Long as I can remember
Never really knowing why
I wish I could be the perfect daughter
But I come back to the water
No matter how hard I try Every turn I take
Every trail I track
Every path I make
Every road leads back to the place I know
Where I cannot go
Where I long to be See the light where the sky meets the sea
It calls me
No one knows how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know
If I go there's just no telling how far I'll go I know everybody on this island
Seems so happy on this island
Everything is by design
I know everybody on this island
Has a role on this island
So maybe I can roll with mine I can lead with pride
I can make us strong
I'll be satisfied if I play along
But the voice inside sings a different song
What is wrong with me See the light as it shines on the sea
It's blinding
But no one knows how deep it goes
And it seems like it's calling out to me
So come find me
And let me know
What's beyond that line
Will I cross that line See the light where the sky meets the sea
It calls me
And no one knows how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know
How far I'll go Well Tamatoa hasn't always been this glam
I was a drab little crab once
Now I know I can be happy as a clam
Because I'm beautiful baby Did your granny say listen to your heart?
Be who you are on the inside?
I need three words to tear her argument apart: your granny lied I'd rather be shiny
Like a treasure from a sunken pirate wreck
Scrub the deck and make it look shiny
I will sparkle like a wealthy woman's neck
Just a sec, don't ya know
Fish are dumb, dumb, dumb
They chase anything that glitters, beginners
Oh and here they come, come, come to the brightest thing that glitters
Mmm fish dinners
I just love free food (free food) and you look like sea food (sea food) Well, well, well
Little Maui's havin' trouble with his look
You little semi, demi, mini god
Ouch what a terrible performance get the hook
Get it?
You don't swing it like you used to, man
Yet I have to give you credit from my start
And your tattoos on the outside
For just like you I made myself a work of art
I'll never hide
I can't I'm too shiny
Watch me dazzle like a diamond in the rough
Strut my stuff, my stuff is so shiny
Send your armies but they'll never be enough
My shell's too tough, Maui man
You can try, try, try but you can't expect a demigod to beat a decapod
Look it up
You will die, die, die now it's time for me to take apart your achin' heart Far from the ones who abandoned you
Chasin' the love of the humans who made you feel wanted
You tried to be tough but your armor's just not hard enough
Maui, now it's time to kick your heiney
Ever seen someone so shiny Soak it in 'cause it's the last you'll ever see
C'est la vie, mon ami
I'm so shiny
Now I'll eat you so prepare your final plea just for me
You'll never be quite as shiny
You wish you were nice and shiny What I love most about rivers is
You can't step in the same river twice
The water's always changing, always flowing But people, I guess, can't live like that
We all must pay a price
To be safe, we lose our chance of ever knowing What's around the river bend
Waiting just around the river bend I look once more just around the river bend
Beyond the shore where the gulls fly free
Don't know what for what I dream the day might send
Just around the river bend for me, coming for me I feel it there beyond those trees
Or right behind these waterfalls
Can I ignore that sound of distant drumming? For a handsome sturdy husband who builds handsome sturdy walls
And never dreams that something might be coming? Just around the river bend
Just around the river bend I look once more just around the river bend
Beyond the shore somewhere past the sea
Don't know what for why do all my dreams extend
Just around the river bend, just around the river bend Should I choose the smoothest course
Steady as the beating drum? Should I marry Kocoum?
Is all my dreaming at an end?
Or do you still wait for me, dream giver
Just around the river bend? In every job that must be done
There is an element of fun
You find the fun and snap!
The job's a game And every task you undertake
Becomes a piece of cake
A lark! A spree! It's very clear to see that A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
The medicine go down, the medicine go down
Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
In a most delightful way A robin feathering his nest has very little time to rest
While gathering his bits of twine and twig
Though quite intent in his pursuit
He has a merry tune to toot
He knows a song will move the job along For a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
The medicine go down, the medicine go down
Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
In a most delightful way The honey bee that fetch the nectar from the flowers to the comb
Never tired of ever buzzing to and fro
Because they take a little nip from every flower that they sip
And hence (And hence)
They find (They find)
Their task is not a grind Ah, ah, ah! Ma chere Mademoiselle, it is with deepest pride
and greatest pleasure that we welcome you tonight,
And now we invite you to relax, let us pull up a

its fine dining we suggest, be our guest, be our guest, be our guest! life is so unnerving
for a servant who's not serving

ten years we've been rusting

But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow When we finally kiss goodnight
How I hate going out in the storm
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm The fire is slowly dying
And my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow When we finally kiss goodnight
How I hate going out in the storm
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm The fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow As long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo
Put them together and what have you got
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo Salagadoola mechicka boola
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo
It'll do magic, believe it or not
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo Yes, salagadoola means
Mechicka booleroo
But the thing mabob that does the job
Is bibbidi-bobbidi-boo I got myself a notion
And one I know that you'll understand
To set the world in motion by reaching out for each other's hand Maybe we'll discover
What we shoulda known all along
One way or another, together's where we both belong If we listen to each other's heart
We'll find we're never too far apart
And maybe love is a reason why
For the first time ever, we're seein' it eye to eye If a wall should come between us
Too high to climb, too hard to break through
I know that love'll lead us
And find a way to bring me to you So don't be in a hurry
Think before you count us out
You don't have to worry
I won't ever let you drown
(Nothing's gonna stop us now) If we listen to each other's heart
We'll find we're never too far apart
And maybe love is a reason why
For the first time ever, we're seein' it eye to eye Love is why we're seein' it eye to eye
(Yes, we are seein' it eye to eye)
Seein' it eye to
(Love is why we're seein' it)
I think we're seein' it eye to eye
(eye to eye)
eye to
We're seein' it eye to eye
(eye to eye!) If you're ever lonely, then stop!
You don't have to be
After all, it's only a beat away from you to me
(Take a look inside and see) If we listen to each other's heart
We'll find we're never too far apart
And maybe love is a reason why
For the first time ever, we're seein' it eye to eye Seein' it eye to
Seein' it eye to eye
We're seein' it eye to eye, baby
For the first time
For the first time eye to eye
Seein't it
Seein' it, baby
Seein' it eye to
For the first time ever
Hey yeah

And that's what botherin' me
I wanna be a man, mancub
And stroll right into town
And be just like the other men
I'm tired of monkeyin' around Oh, oobee doo
I wanna be like you
I wanna walk like you

Cruella De Vil
If she doesn't scare you
No evil thing will
To see her is to
Take a sudden chill
Cruella, Cruella
She's like a spider waiting
For the kill
Look out for Cruella De Vil At first you think
Cruella is the devil
But after time has worn
Away the shock
You come to realize
You've seen her kind of eyes
Watching you from underneath
A rock! This vampire bat
This inhuman beast
She ought to be locked up
And never released
The world was such
A wholesome place until
Cruella, Cruella De Vil Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries and your strife
I mean the bare necessities
Old Mother Nature's recipes
That brings the bare necessities of life Wherever I wander, wherever I roam
I couldn't be fonder of my big home
The bees are buzzin' in the tree
To make some honey just for me
When you look under the rocks and plants
And take a glance at the fancy ants
Then maybe try a few The bare necessities of life will come to you
They'll come to you! Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries and your strife
I mean the bare necessities
That's why a bear can rest at ease
With just the bare necessities of life Now when you pick a pawpaw
Or a prickly pear
And you prick a raw paw
Well next time beware
Don't pick the prickly pear by the paw
When you pick a pear
Try to use the claw
But you don't need to use the claw
When you pick a pear of the big pawpaw
Have I given you a clue? The bare necessities of life will come to you
They'll come to you! Oh man this is really living
So just try and relax, yeah cool it
Fall apart in my backyard
'Cause let me tell you something little britches
If you act like that bee acts, uh uh
You're working too hard And don't spend your time lookin' around
For something you want that can't be found
When you find out you can live without it
And go along not thinkin' about it
I'll tell you something true The bare necessities of life will come to you Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries and your strife
I mean the bare necessities
That's why a bear can rest at ease
With just the bare necessities of life
With just the bare necessities of life I see what's happening yeah
You're face to face with greatness and it's strange
You don't even know how you feel
It's adorable!
Well, it's nice to see that humans never change
Open your eyes, let's begin
Yes, it's really me
It's Maui, breathe it in
I know its a lot; the hair, the bod
When you're staring at a demigod What can I say except you're welcome
For the tides, the sun, the sky
Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome
I'm just an ordinary demi-guy Hey!
What has two thumbs and pulled up the sky
When you were waddling yay high
This guy!
When the nights got cold
Who stole you fire from down below
You're lookin' at him, yo
Oh!
Also I lassoed the sun
(You're welcome)
To stretch your days and bring you fun
Also I harnessed the breeze
(You're welcome!)
To fill your sails and shake your trees So what can I say except you're welcome
For the islands I pulled from the sea
There's no need to pray, it's okay, you're welcome
Ha! I guess it's just my way of being me
You're welcome!
You're welcome! Well, come to think of it
Kid, honestly I could go on and on
I could explain every natural phenomenon
The tide? The grass? The ground?
Oh, that was Maui just messin' around
I killed an eel, I buried its guts
Sprouted a tree, now you've got coconuts
What's the lesson? What is the takeaway?
Don't mess with Maui when he's on the breakaway And the tapestry here on my skin
Is a map of the victories I win
Look where I've been
I make everything happen
Look at that mean mini Maui just tickety-tappin'
Heh, heh, heh ,heh, heh, heh, hey! Well anyway, let me say you're welcome (You're welcome)
For the wonderful world you know
Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome (You're welcome)
Well, come to think of it, I gotta go!
Hey, it's your day to say you're welcome (You're welcome)
'Cause I'm gonna need that boat
I'm sailing away, away, you're welcome (You're welcome)
'Cause Maui can do anything but float! (You're welcome)
You're welcome! (You're welcome)

Disney
2000 Leagues Under the Sea
Got a whale of a tale to tell ya, lads
A whale of a tale or two
'Bout the flapping fish and girls I've loved
On nights like this with the moon above
A whale of a tale and it's all true,
I swear by my tatoo
There was Mermaid Minnie
Met her down in Madagascar
She would kiss me
Anytime that I would ask her
Then one evening
Her flame of love blew out
Blow me down and pick me up,
She swapped me for a trout!
Got a whale of a tale to tell ya, lads
A whale of a tale or two
'Bout the flapping fish and girls I've loved
On nights like this with the moon above
A whale of a tale and it's all true,
I swear by my tatoo
There was Typhoon Tessie
Met her on the coast of Java
When we kissed I
Bubbled up like molten lava
Then she gave me
The scare of my young life
Blow me down, and pick me up
She was the captain's wife!
Got a whale of a tale to tell ya, lads
A whale of a tale or two
'Bout the flapping fish and girls I've loved
On nights like this with the moon above
A whale of a tale and it's all true,
I swear by my tatoo
Then there was Harpoon Hannah
Had a face that made you shudder
Lips like Fish hooks
And a nose just like a rudder
If I kissed her
And held her tenderly
(Held her tenderly)
There's no sea monster big enough
To ever frighten me!
Got a whale of a tale to tell ya, lads
A whale of a tale or two
'Bout the flapping fish and girls I've loved
On nights like this with the moon above
A whale of a tale and it's all true,
I swear by my tatoo! With tuppence for paper and strings
You can have your own set of wings
With your feet on the ground
You're a bird in a flight
With your fist holding tight
To the string of your kite Oh, oh, oh!
Let's go fly a kite
Up to the highest height!
Let's go fly a kite and send it soaring
Up through the atmosphere
Up where the air is clear
Oh, let's go fly a kite! When you send it flyin' up there
All at once you're lighter than air
You can dance on the breeze
Over 'ouses and trees
With your first 'olding tight
To the string of your kite Oh, oh, oh!
Let's go fly a kite
Up to the highest height!
Let's go fly a kite and send it soaring
Up through the atmosphere
Up where the air is clear
Oh, let's go fly a kite! Want to know a secret?
Promise not to tell?
When you're standing by a wishing well
Make a wish into the well
That's all you have to do
And if you hear it echoing
Your wish will soon come true I'm wishing for the one I love
To find me today
I'm hoping
And I'm dreaming of
The nice things he'll say I'm wishing for the one I love
To find me today Today!
Now that I've found you
Hear what I have to say
One Song
I have but one song
One song
Only for you One heart
Tenderly beating
Ever entreating
Constant and true One love
That has possessed me
One love
Thrilling me through One song
My heart keeps singing
Of one love
Only for you Let's get down to business, to defeat the Huns
Did they send me daughters, when I asked for sons?
You're the saddest bunch I ever met
But you can bet before we're through
Mister, I'll make a man out of you Tranquil as a forest but on fire within
Once you find your center, you are sure to win
You're a spineless, pale, pathetic lot
And you haven't got a clue
Somehow I'll make a man out of you I'm never gonna catch my breath
Say goodbye to those who knew me
Boy, was I a fool in school for cutting gym
This guy's got 'em scared to death
Hope he doesn't see right through me
Now I really wish that I knew how to swim Be a man
We must be swift as the coursing river
Be a man
With all the force of a great typhoon
Be a man
With all the strength of a raging fire
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon Time is racing toward us till the Huns arrive
Heed my every order and you might survive
You're unsuited for the rage of war
So pack up, go home, you're through
How could I make a man out of you? Be a man
We must be swift as the coursing river
Be a man
With all the force of a great typhoon
Be a man
With all the strength of a raging fire
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon Be a man
We must be swift as the coursing river
Be a man
With all the force of a great typhoon
Be a man
With all the strength of a raging fire
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon (Ou mata e matagi)
I have crossed the horizon to find you
(Ou loto mamaina toa)
I know your name
(Manatu atu)
They have stolen the heart from inside you
(Taku pelepele)
But this does not define you
(Manatu atu)
This is not who you are
You know who you are Look at this stuff, isn't it neat?
Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?
Wouldn't you think I'm the girl
The girl who has everything?
Look at this trove, treasures untold
How many wonders can one cavern hold?
Lookin' around here you'd think
Sure, she's got everything I've got gadgets and gizmos aplenty
I've got whooz-its and whatz-its galore
You want thingamabobs?
I got twenty
But who cares?
No big deal
I want more I want to be where the people are
I want to see
Want to see 'em dancing
Walking around on those
Whadd'ya call 'em? Oh, feet
Flipping your fins you don't get too far
Legs are required for jumping, dancing
Strolling along down a
What's that word again? Street Up where they walk
Up where they run
Up where they stay all day in the sun
Wandering free
Wish I could be
Part of that world What would I give
If I could live
Out of these waters?
What would I pay
To spend a day
Warm on the sand?
Betcha on land
They understand
That they don't reprimand their daughters
Bright young women
Sick of swimming
Ready to stand And I'm ready to know what the people know
Ask 'em my questions
And get some answers
What's a fire and why does it
What's the word? Burn? When's it my turn?
Wouldn't I love
Love to explore that shore above?
Out of the sea
Wish I could be
Part of that world
Out of the sea
Wish I could be
Part of your world When somebody loved me
Everything was beautiful
Every hour we spent together
Lives within my heart And when she was sad
I was there to dry her tears
And when she was happy so was I
When she loved me Through the summer and the fall
We had each other that was all
Just she and I together
Like it was meant to be And when she was lonely
I was there to comfort her
And I knew that she loved me So the years went by
I stayed the same
She began to drift away
I was left alone Still I waited for the day
When she'd say
I will always love you Lonely and forgotten
Never thought she'd look my way
She smiled at me and held me Just like she used to do
Like she loved me
When she loved me When somebody loved me
Everything was beautiful
Every hour we spent together
Lives within my heart When she loved me, hey All those days watching from the windows
All those years outside looking in
All that time never even knowing
Just how blind I've been
Now I'm here blinking in the starlight
Now I'm here suddenly I see
Standing here it's all so clear
I'm where I'm meant to be And at last I see the light
And it's like the fog has lifted
And at last I see the light
And it's like the sky is new
And it's warm and real and bright
And the world has somehow shifted
All at once everything looks different
Now that I see you All those days chasing down a daydream
All those years living in a blur
All that time never truly seeing
Things, the way they were
Now she's here shining in the starlight
Now she's here suddenly I know
If she's here it's crystal clear
I'm where I'm meant to go And at last I see the light And it's like the fog has lifted And at last I see the light And it's like the sky is new And it's warm and real and bright
And the world has somehow shifted
All at once everything is different
Now that I see you Now that I see you Wonderful, marvelous,
The man with the strength of many.
Brave and bold with a heart of gold,
John Henry was a mighty man.
Born with a hammer right in his hand. Well, come on John,
You're the one that we're depending on.
Swing that hammer with all your might,
I know you can show them how to do it right. John Henry, John Henry,
John Henry is a mighty man.
Born with a hammer,
A ten pound hammer,
A twenty pound hammer right in his hand. I heard John's mama liked to sew at night,
So he pulled down the moon for a little bit of light.
It took a lot of cooking to keep John fed,
Ten dozen eggs and eight loves of bread. John Henry, John Henry,
John Henry is a mighty man.
Born with a hammer, born with a hammer,
Born with a hammer right in his hand. He plowed the earth so wide and deep,
The seed he sowed the ground had to keep.
His hammer hit the earth with such a mighty blow,
Everything he planted would jump up and grow. John Henry, John Henry,
John Henry is a powerful man.
All our lives we've been so poor,
John let me show you what we're working for. Canaan Land, Canaan Land,
Everybody workin' for the Canaan Land.
Home and freedom hand in hand,
Workin' for the Canaan Land. Oh, movin' on down the line,
John Henry came right on time.
Movin' on down the line,
John Henry came right on time. Home and freedom hand in hand,
Workin' for the Canaan Land. John Henry, John Henry,
John Henry is a mighty man.
John Henry, John Henry,
John Henry is a powerful man. Steel drivin' man,
John Henry was.
Steel drivin' man,
Oh yes he was.
So proud, defiant,
A gentle giant,
A steel drivin' natural man. Well, a-come on, John,
You're the one that we're dependin' on.
Swing that hammer, bust that rock,
Come on, give it everything you've got. John Henry, John Henry,
John Henry is a mighty man.
Born with a hammer, born with a hammer,
Born with a hammer right in his hand. John and the drill made the valley shake,
Rumblin' almost caused an earthquake.
Thunder and lightning was everywhere,
Oh, Lord, that battle was beyond compare. John Henry, John Henry,
John Henry is a powerful man.
Born with a hammer, born with a hammer,
Born with a hammer right in his hand. No mountain too high,
No valley too low,
No river too wide,
No place too far to go. If you believe, you can overcome.
The battle is already won,
Just keep on keepin' on.
Stand tall, just like John. No matter who you are,
No matter where you're from,
Nothing can stop you,
From who you can become. Just keep on keepin' on,
Stand tall, just like John.
Just keep on keepin' on,
Stand tall, just like John. No matter who you are,
No matter where you're from,
Nothing can stop you,
From who you can become. Just keep on keepin' on,
Stand tall, just like John.
Just keep on keepin' on,
Stand tall, just like John.
Just keep on keepin' on,
Stand tall, just like John.
Just keep on keepin' on,
Stand tall, just like John. Do you wanna build a snowman?
Come on let's go and play
I never see you anymore
Come out the door
It's like you've gone away We used to be best buddies
And now we're not
I wish you would tell me why!
Do you wanna build a snowman?
It doesn't have to be a snowman
Okay, bye Do you wanna build a snowman?
Or ride our bikes around the halls
I think some company is overdue
I've started talking to the
Pictures on the walls It gets a little lonely
All these empty rooms (these empty rooms)
Just watching the hours
Tick by Do you wanna build a snowman?
(Do you wanna build a snowman?)
It doesn't have to be a snowman
(Don't have to be a snowman)
Okay, bye Elsa?
Please, I know you're in there (I know you're in there)
People are asking where you've been
They say, "have courage" and I'm trying to (trying to)
I'm right out here for you (here for you)
Just let me in (just let me in) We only have each other (we only have each other)
It's just you and me
What are we gonna do? (what are we gonna do?) Do you wanna build a snowman?
Do you wanna build a snowman?
It doesn't have to be a snowman
Okay, bye Some day my prince will come
Some day we'll meet again
And away to his castle we'll go
To be happy forever I know Some day when spring is here
We'll find a love anew
And the birds will sing
And wedding bells will ring
Someday when my dreams come true La la lu, La la lu
Oh, my little star sweeper
I'll sweep the stardust for you La la lu, La la lu
Little soft fluffy sleeper
Here comes a pink cloud for you La la lu, La la lu
Little wandering angel
Fold up your wings close your eyes La la lu, La la lu
And may love be your keeper
La la lu, La la lu, La la lu Hakuna Matata!
What a wonderful phrase
Hakuna Matata!
Ain't no passing craze It means no worries
For the rest of your days
It's our problem-free philosophy
Hakuna Matata! Why, when he was a young warthog
When I was a young wart-hoooog!
Very nice!
Thanks!
He found his aroma lacked a certain appeal
He could clear the Savannah after every meal
I'm a sensitive soul, though I seem thick-skinned
And it hurt that my friends never stood downwind
And oh, the shame
(He was ashamed!)
Thought of changin' my name
(Oh, what's in a name?)
And I got downhearted
(How did you feel?)
Every time that I-
Pumbaa! Not in front of the kids!
Oh... sorry Hakuna Matata!
What a wonderful phrase
Hakuna Matata!
Ain't no passing craze
It means no worries
For the rest of your days
Yeah, sing it, kid!
It's our problem-free philosophy
Hakuna Matata! Hakuna Matata
Hakuna Matata
Hakuna Matata
Hakuna It means no worries
For the rest of your days
It's our problem-free philosophy
Hakuna Matata From the day we arrive on the planet
And blinking, step into the sun
There's more to see than can ever be seen
More to do than can ever be done There's far too much to take in here
More to find than can ever be found
But the sun rolling high
Through the sapphire sky
Keeps great and small on the endless round It's the circle of life
And it moves us all
Through despair and hope
Through faith and love Till we find our place
On the path unwinding
In the circle
The circle of life It's the circle of life
And it moves us all
Through despair and hope
Through faith and love Till we find our place
On the path unwinding
In the circle
The circle of life Mmmmmm
Mmmmmm
So this is love
Mmmmmm
So this is love
So this is what makes life divine
I'm all aglow, mmmmmm
And now I know
And now I know
The key to all heaven is mine
My heart has wings, mmmmmm
And I can fly
I'll touch every star in the sky
So this is the miracle
That I've been dreaming of
Mmmmmm
Mmmmmm
So this is love Oh, this is the night, it's a beautiful night
And we call it bella notte
Look at the skies, they have stars in their eyes
On this lovely bella notte Side by side with your loved one
You'll find enchantment here
The night will weave its magic spell
When the one you love is near For this is the night, and the heavens are right
On this lovely bella notte This is the night, it's a beautiful night
And we call it bella notte
Look at the skies, they have stars in their eyes
On this lovely bella notte Side by side with your loved one
You'll find enchantment here
The night will weave its magic spell
When the one you love is near For this is the night, and the heavens are right
On this lovely bella notte Look at me,
I will never pass for a perfect bride, or a perfect daughter.
Can it be,
I'm not meant to play this part?
Now I see, that if I were truly to be myself,
I would break my family's heart. Who is that girl I see, staring straight back at me?
Why is my reflection someone I don't know?
Somehow I cannot hide
Who I am, though I've tried.
When will my reflection show, who I am, inside?
How I pray, that a time will come,
I can free myself, from their expectations
On that day, I'll discover someway to be myself, and to make my family proud.
They want a docile lamb,
No-one knows who I am.
Must there be a secret me,
I'm forced to hide?
Must I pretend that I am someone else for all time?
When will my reflection show, who I am inside?
When will my reflection show, who I am inside? I know you
I walked with you
Once Upon a dream
I know you That gleam in your eyes
Is so familiar a gleam
Yet I know it's true
That visions are seldom what they seem But if I know you
I know what you do
You'll love me at once
The way you did once upon a dream La da la da la ahahahahah
But if I know you
I know what you do
You'll love me at once The way you did once upon a dream
I know you
I walked with you
Once Upon a dream I know you
That gleam in your eyes
Is so familiar a gleam
Yet I know it's true That visions are seldom what they seem
But if I know you
I know what you do
You'll love me at once The way you did once upon a dream There's a calm surrender to the rush of day
When the heat of the rolling world can be turned away
An enchanted moment and it sees me through
It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you And can you feel the love tonight? It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer that we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight? How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds believe the very best There's a time for everyone, if they only learn
That the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours And can you feel the love tonight? It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer that we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight? How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds believe the very best
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds believe the very best Ou mata e matagi

All you need The dancers are practising
They dance to an ancient song
(Who needs a new song? This old one's all we need) This tradition is our mission
And Moana, there's so much to do
(Make way!)
Don't trip on the taro root
That's all you need We share everything we make
(We make)
We joke and we weave our baskets
(Aha!)
The fishermen come back from the sea Moana:
I wanna see Chief Tui:
Don't walk away
Moana, stay on the ground now
Our people will need a chief
And there you are Chief Tui and Sina:
There comes a day
When you're gonna look around
And realize happiness is
Where you are Chief Tui:
Consider the coconut

Consider its tree
We use each part of the coconut
That's all we need Sina:
We make our nets from the fibers

The water is sweet inside

In time you'll learn just as I did
Chief Tui and Sina:
You must find happiness right
Where you are Gramma Tala:
I like to dance with the water
The undertow and the waves
The water is mischievous
Ha! I like how it misbehaves The village may think I'm crazy
Or say that I drift too far
But once you know what you like, well
There you are You are your father's daughter
Stubbornness and pride
Mind what he says but remember
You may hear a voice inside
And if the voice starts to whisper
To follow the farthest star
Moana, that voice inside is
Who you are Villagers:
We make our nets from the fibers
(We weave our nets from the fibers)
The water is sweet inside
(And we taste the sweet inside)
We use the leaves to build fires

We cook up the meat inside
(We have mouths to feed inside) Chief Tui:
The village believes in us
(That's right!)
The village believes
(Ha!)
The island gives us what we need
And no one leaves Moana:
So here I'll stay
My home, my people beside me
And when I think of tomorrow
There we are I'll lead the way
I'll have my people to guide me
We'll build our future together
Villagers: Where we are Moana:
'Cause every path leads you back to
Villagers:
Where you are
Moana:
You can find happiness right -
Villagers:
Where you are
Where you are Don't you disrespect me little man
Don't you derogate or deride
You're in my world now, not your world
And I got friends on the other side
(He's got friends on the other side) That's and echo gentleman
Just a little something we have here in Louisiana
A little parlor trick, don't worry Sit down at my table, put your mind at ease
If you relax it will enable me to do anything I please
I can read your future, I can change it 'round some too
I look deep into your heart and soul You do have have a soul, don't you, Lawrence?
Make your wildest dreams come true I got voodoo, I got voodoo
I got things I didn't even try
And I got friends on the other side
(He's got friends on the other side) The cards, the cards, the cards will tell
The past, the present and the future as well
The cards, the cards, just take three
Take a little trip into your future with me Now you, young man are from across the sea
You come from two long lines of royalty
I'm a royal myself on my mother's side
Your lifestyle's high but your funds are low
You need to marry a little honey who's daddy got dough Mom and dad cut you off, huh, playboy?
Now y'all better get hitched but hitching ties you down
You just want to be free, hop from place to place
But freedom takes green It's the green, it's the green, it's the green you need
And when I look into your future it's the green that I see On you little man, I don't want wanna waste much time
You've been pushed 'round all your life
You've been pushed 'round by your mother
And your sister and your brother
And if you was married you'd be pushed 'round by your wife But in your future the you I see
Is exactly the man you always wanted to be
Shake my hand, come on boys
Won't you shake a poor sinner's hand? Yes, are you ready?
(Are you ready?)
Are you ready? Transformation central
Transformation central
Transformation central
Transformation central Transformafication central, can you feel it?
You're changing, you're changing, you're changing alright
I hope you're satisfied, but if you ain't don't blame me
You can blame my friends on the other side You got what you wanted
What you want's what you get
Hush Ain't it a glorious day?
Right as a mornin' in May
I feel like I could fly
Have you ever seen the grass
So green, or a bluer sky? Oh it's a jolly 'oliday with Mary
Mary makes your 'eart so light!
When the day is gray and ordianry
Mary makes the sun shine bright!
Oh, 'appiness is bloomin' all around 'er
The daffodils are smilin' at the dove
When Mary 'olds your 'and
You feel so grand
Your 'eart starts beatin' like
A big brass band!
It's a jolly 'oliday with Mary
No wonder that it's Mary that we love! Oh it's a jolly 'oliday with Mary
Mary makes your 'eart so light!
When the day is gray and ordianry
Mary makes the sun shine bright!
Oh, 'appiness is bloomin' all around 'er
The daffodils are smilin' at the dove
When Mary 'olds your 'and
You feel so grand
Your 'eart starts beatin' like
A big brass band!
It's a jolly 'oliday with Mary
No wonder that it's Mary that we love! Oh, it's a jolly holiday with you, Bert
Gentlemen like you are few
Though you're just a diamond
In the rough, Bert
Underneath your blood is blue!
You'd never think of pressing
Your advantage
Forbearance is the hallmark of your creed
A lady needn't fear when you are near
Your sweet gentility is crystal clear!
Oh, it's a jolly holiday with you, Bert
A jolly, jolly holiday with you! It's true that Mavis and Sybil 'ave
Ways that are winning
And Prudence and Gwendolyn
Set your 'eart spinning
Phoebe's delightful, Maude is disarming
Janice, Felicia, Lydia--charming
Cynthia's dashing, Vivian's sweet
Stephanie's smashing, Priscilla a treat
Veronica, Millicent, Agnes, and Jane
Convivial company, time and again
Dorcas and Phyllis and Glynis are sorts
I'll agree are three jolly good sports
But cream of the crop, tip of the top
It's Mary Poppins, and there we stop! If I never knew you
If I never felt this love
I would have no inkling of
How precious life can be And if I never knew you
I would never have a clue
How at last I'd find in you
The missing part of me In this world so full of fear
Full of rage and lies
I can see the truth so clear
In your eyes
So dry your eyes And I'm so grateful to you
I'd have lived my whole life through
Lost forever
If I never knew you If I never knew you
I'd be safe but half as real
Never knowing I could feel
A love so strong and true I'm so grateful to you
I'd have lived my whole life through
Lost forever
If I never knew you I thought our love would be so beautiful Somehow we made the whole world bright I never knew that fear and hate could be so strong
All they'd leave us were these whispers in the night
But still my heart is singing
We were right If I never knew you
There's no moment I regret
If I never knew this love
I would have no inkling of
If our time has gone too fast I've lived at last
How precious life can be I thought our love would be so beautiful
Somehow we'd make the whole world bright I thought our love would be so beautiful
We'd turn the darkness into light And still my heart is singing
We were right We were right
And if I never knew you
I'd have lived my whole life through Empty as the sky Never knowing why
Lost forever I know you
I walked with you
Once Upon a dream
I know you That gleam in your eyes
Is so familiar a gleam
Yet I know it's true
That visions are seldom what they seem But if I know you
I know what you do
You'll love me at once
The way you did once upon a dream La da la da la ahahahahah
But if I know you
I know what you do
You'll love me at once The way you did once upon a dream
I know you
I walked with you
Once Upon a dream I know you
That gleam in your eyes
Is so familiar a gleam
Yet I know it's true That visions are seldom what they seem
But if I know you
I know what you do
You'll love me at once The way you did once upon a dream You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
When the road looks rough ahead
And you're miles and miles
From your nice warm bed
Just remember what your old pal said
Boy, you've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
You've got troubles, well I've got 'em too
There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you
We stick together and we see it through
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me Some other folks might be
A little bit smarter than I am
Bigger and stronger too
Maybe
But none of them will ever love you the way I do
It's me and you
And as the years go by
Boys, our friendship will never die
You're gonna see
It's our destiny
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me I have often dreamed of a far off place
Where a hero's welcome would be waiting for me
Where the crowds would cheer, when they see my face
And a voice keeps saying this is where I'm meant to be I'll be there someday, I can go the distance
I will find my way if I can be strong
I know every mile would be worth my while
When I go the distance, I'll be right where I belong Down an unknown road to embrace my fate
Though that road may wander, it will lead me to you
And a thousand years would be worth the wait
It might take a lifetime but somehow I'll see it through And I won't look back, I can go the distance
And I'll stay on track, no I won't accept defeat
It's an uphill slope
But I won't loose hope, 'till I go the distance
And my journey is complete, oh yeah But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part
For a hero's strength is measured by his heart, oh Like a shooting star, I will go the distance
I will search the world, I will face its harms
I don't care how far, I can go the distance
'Till I find my hero's welcome waiting in your arms I will search the world, I will face its harms
'Till I find my hero's welcome waiting in your arms I've got no strings
To hold me down
To make me fret
Or make me frown
I had strings
But now I'm free
There are no strings on me Hi-ho the me-ri-o
That's the only way to go
I want the world to know
Nothing ever worries me I've got no strings
So I have fun
I'm not tied up to anyone
They've got strings
But you can see
There are no strings on me You have no strings
Your arms is free
To love me by the Zuider Zee
Ya, ya, ya
If you would woo
I'd bust my strings for you You've got no strings
Comme ci comme ca
Your savoire-faire is ooh la la
I've got strings
But entre nous
I'd cut my strings for you Down where the Volga flows
There's a Russian rendezvous
Where me and Ivan go
But I'd rather go with you, hey There are no strings on me Come stop your crying
It will be alright
Just take my hand
And hold it tight I will protect you
From all around you
I will be here
Don't you cry For one so small,
You seem so strong
My arms will hold you,
Keep you safe and warm
This bond between us
Can't be broken
I will be here
Don't you cry 'Cause you'll be in my heart
Yes, you'll be in my heart
From this day on
Now and forever more
You'll be in my heart
No matter what they say
You'll be here in my heart
Always Why can't they understand the way we feel
They just don't trust what they can't explain
I know we're different, but deep inside us
We're not that different at all And you'll be in my heart
Yes you'll be in my heart
From this day on
Now and forever more Don't listen to them
'Cause what do they know
We need each other, to have, to hold
They'll see in time, I know When destiny calls you, you must be strong
I may not be with you
But you got to hold on
They'll see in time, I know
We'll show them together 'Cause you'll be in my heart
Believe me you'll be in my heart
I'll be there from this day on
Now and forever more You'll be in my heart
No matter what they say
You'll be here in my heart
Always Always I'll be with you
I'll be there for you always
Always and always Just look over your shoulder
Just look over your shoulder
Just look over your shoulder

DJ Khaled Please, Khaled, don't pair me or compare me
Unless the said party is a rare breed
The stories I hear, they tend to mirror me
At this point now, rap is only therapy
President Push, I'm more Eric B
I ain't no joke, check out my melody
Felony, felony, felony, that's all they selling me
But 2 million in large bills is billing me
I was on the wrong side of the law
Like Pac was on the wrong side of the car
Like B.I.G. at the Soul Train Awards
The moral is all grace been driven
G Wagons are bulletproof
The ones before me got snatched like bullet tooth
Tony nigga, only one left from the drug era
The jewelry weighs more in the drug mirror Yeah, what you see when you look in the mirror, nigga? Haha
Yeah, I know who the fuck I am Yuugh, tell me how you fit in
Was you a street nigga when Nas said it's written
When Reasonable Doubt dropped, how was you living?
I was leading up the grinding in my kitchen
Getting work from Detroit like a piston
We was on a mission, stuff it in a Michelin
I could spend a year reminiscing
The length of your career, reminiscing
We can't occupy the same space
We ain't even running the same race
When it come to these bitches, it ain't the same chase
Moynat versus lean, we ain't the same taste
Therefore, it's no comparison
To be mentioned with you niggas is embarrassing
I am one Joe blow, you know my narrative
Clear your sinus like Claritin
Push When you look in the mirror, what do you see, nigga?
'Cause I know when I look in the mirror, I know what I see
You peasants don't deserve my presence You portraying other individuals
Me, I'm just weighing my residuals
From where success is the bare minimal
You a rapper, I'm a criminal
I had money before they found y'all
That's why I feel funny around y'all
Lord, bless those praying for my downfall
If I get too deep, don't let me drown, y'all
Hearing 'em talking 'bout how to flip a key
Started moving that Daddy Kane and Nicky D
Had the whole YPD sick of me
Don't sit, if you get tired, just pick a knee
Bet it all or bet it large
Now the coke or these pills, the crack, all these credit cards
I just laughed and I shrug at it

Make 'em stay there Swerving in my lo-lo,
Head on the swivel
You know serving me's a no no
Clean as a whistle as I pull out in my Rolls Royce
Yellow bone passenger they see it, they say oh boy!
Tell Khaled back it up, my niggas call me Loco
Down for armed trafficking, don't make me pull that fo-fo
Ask you what you laughing at
Represent that mud life (mud life)
Dirty money bitch you better get your mug right (mug right)
We come together holding hands and holla thug life (thug life)
We all strapped in all black
It's like fuck life
(All we do is win)
You riding or what (what!)
'Cause we riding tonight (night!)
Now she riding with me cause you wasn't ridin' her right, All I do is win win win no matter what
Got money on my mind I can never get enough
And every time I step up in the buildin'
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there
And they say yeah
And they stay there
Up down, up down, up down
'Cause all I do is win win win
And if you goin' in put your hands in the air
Make 'em stay there Heat in the kitchen, pot on the stove
Water getting boiled, dope being sold
Snoopy in the hoopty, system overload
I've been runnin' this rap game since I was twenty years old
I hung with the worst of 'em
Bust till I burst on 'em
Floss 'em up, toss 'em up, Hardaway, cross 'em up
Pardon me I'm bossin' up, pressure up, bless ya bruh
Don't mess with us
We like the "U" in the 80's
Back to back set a trap
Hit the lick, get it back
Hit the trick, jump the track
Bitch I want my money back
Time and time again while I'm sipping on this gin
Al Davis said it best, just win baby win All I do is win win win no matter what
Got money on my mind I can never get enough
And every time I step up in the buildin'
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there
And they say yeah
And they stay there
Up down, up down, up down
'Cause all I do is win win win
And if you goin' in put your hands in the air
Make 'em stay there (Get 'em up) I'm on one
(Get 'em up) Fuck it I'm on one
(Get 'em up) I said I'm on one, DJ Khaled uh I'm getting so throwed
I ain't work this hard since I was eighteen
Apologize if I say, anything I don't mean
Like whats up with your best friend?
We could all have some fun, believe me
And whats up with these new niggas?
And why they think it all comes so easy But get it while you here boy
Cause all that hype don't feel the same next year boy
Yeah and I'll be right here in my spot
With a little more cash than I already got
Trippin' off you 'cause you had your shot
With my skin tanned and my hair long
And my fans who been so patient,
Me and forty back to work but we still smell like a vacation
Hate the rumors, hate your bullshit
Hate these fucking allegations,
I'm just feeling like the throne is for the taking, watch me take it All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it till it's done
And I don't really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older so somebody shoulda told ya I'm on one, yeah,
Fuck it, I'm on one
Yeah, I said I'm on one fuck it, I'm on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be gotten and I'ma get that shit
Cause I'm on one, I said fuck it I'm on one I'm burning purple flowers
It's burning my chest
I bury the most cash and burning the rest
Walking on the clouds, suspended in thin air
Do ones beneath me recognize the red bottoms I wear
Burner in the belt
Move the kids to the hills (Boss)
Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill
Kiss you on ya neck and tell ya everything is great
Even though I'm out on bond I might be facin' eight's
Still running with the same niggas 'til the death of me
Ever seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully
Ever made love to the woman of your dreams
In a room full of money out in London as she screams
Baby, I could take it there
Call Marc Jacobs personally to make a pair
So yeah, we on one, the feeling ain't fair (Khaled)
And it's double M G until I get the chair All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it till it's done
And I don't really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older so somebody shoulda told ya I'm on one, yeah,
Fuck it, I'm on one
Yeah, I said I'm on one, fuck it, I'm on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be gotten and I'ma get that shit
Cause I'm on one, I said fuck it I'm on one I walk around the club,
fuck everybody
And all my niggas got that Heat I feel like Pat Riley
Yeah, too much money, ain't enough money
You know the feds listening,
nigga what money?
I'm a made nigga
I should dust something
You niggas on the bench
Like the bus coming
Huh, ain't nothing sweet but the swishas
I'm focused might aswell say cheese for the pictures
Oh, I'm about to go Andre the Giant
You a sell out, but I ain't buying
Chopper dissect a nigga like science
Put an end to the world like Mayans
It's a celebration bitches, Mazel Tov
It's a slim chance I fall, olive oil
Tunechi be the name, don't ask me how I got it
I'm killin' these hoes I swear I'm tryna stop the violence All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it till it's done
And I don't really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older so somebody shoulda told ya I'm on one yeah,
Fuck it, I'm on one
Yeah, I said I'm on one, fuck it, I'm on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be gotten and I'ma get that shit
'Cause I'm on one, I said fuck it I'm on one (Get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up) Comme si je n'existais pas

Top back, screamin' money ain't a ting Seen the two G-wagons in my driveway
Facetime, two black bottles by my fireplace
Fell out with your peoples so you took the pictures down

Took you shopping in other places that I won't name

Got my bands up, thanks to the transporter

With all the jewelry on, make sure I'm looking good
Rob who nigga? I wish a nigga would
Point 5, don't shoot, that's how the lames do it
Word on the street somebody put a hit on me
I'm in the foreign, top off, look like I'm worried homie?
Better send them now, got bout a mill on me
You rob me; I kill you, now that's a deal homie
Two-twenty-three
Carbon one-five
Old black bitch with me, that's that forty five
Been real, never snitched nigga my whole life
Heard a nigga whacked him. He shouldn't have testified [Chorus]
If you from the streets like me, put your hands up!

Put em up! I'm hotter than a Kawasaki in the projects
Burning more than rubber, money ain't a object
I'm number 1, and hurt they feelings in the process
Cop a bird, then your really seein progress
I'm buying cars like I'm in a contest
Say my name, rappers lookin like a bomb threat
I'm the winner, these beginners talking nonsense
Brain from your ? till she render me unconscious
I'm so conscious of DNA in my closet
My show account can't take another deposit
Ladies heartthrob labelled me the odd ball
3.5 cause I'm known to start small [Chorus]
If you from the streets like me, put your hands up!
D Boys on my tease, put your hands up!
Independent bad bitches, put your hands up!
If you know this how you living, put your hands up!
Where they at?
Put em up! If you know this how you living, put your hands up!

I got the streets on fire with this one
Somebody pass my ?
That's the new thug passion
This we the best music
Put your hands up! I'll hold you down
I'm on my way All you've been thinking about
Do anything you want and let emotion rule your mind (Rule your mind)
And now you say you dream about doing it anyway

Through it all you stuck with me
Through it all you never ducked off like a coward when he hit me
Get me? Girl I swear to God you the real one and you know it
