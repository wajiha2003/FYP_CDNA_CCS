Above us all the stars are watchin'
There's no place I'd rather be in this world
Your eyes are where I'm lost in
Underneath the chandelier
We're dancin' all alone
There's no reason to hide
What we're feelin' inside
Right now! So baby let's just turn down the lights
And close the door

Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful and I tell her everyday
Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me "Do I look okay? "
I say When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change 'cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are
Yeah Her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh she hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful, and I tell her everyday Oh you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay, you know I'll say When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are The way you are
The way you are
Girl you're amazing
Just the way you are When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are Yeah ¿Qué estás loco?
Se está haciendo difícil esperar,
Estoy tratando de hacerle ver,
Que ella no sabe realmente
Que yo estoy tratando de encontrar una manera,
Y dile a ella todos los días, que sólo va de la mano
Así que ...
Yo no quiero ser,
El único que sabe
Que alguien podría venir y apenas
Dicen que el amor por mí,
Estoy de pie temblando de tierra,
Y estoy pensando que voy a perder, Estribillo:
Porque yo estoy perdiendo mi cabeza,
Estoy perdiendo mi mente,
Estoy perdiendo el control de mí mismo esta vez.
Ella me tiene de perder la cabeza,
Estoy perdiendo mi mente,
Estoy perdiendo a mi manera,
Pero yo creo que ella siente que ya estoy atrapado. ¿Estás hablando conmigo?
Ya estoy atrapado. Me gustaría que me podía ver,
Pero es que lo que
Siente esto debe ser.
Mi amor es como bala
Todo lo que necesita es una inyección para mí para hacer estallar todo por la borda.
No quiero sentir que estoy perdiendo el tiempo,
Va a estar con ustedes y nadie más.
Hasta que me aviso,
Necesito saber en este momento
Porque yo he estado creo que me voy a perder Estribillo:
Porque yo estoy perdiendo mi cabeza,
Estoy perdiendo mi mente,
Estoy perdiendo el control de mí mismo esta vez.
Ella me tiene de perder la cabeza,
Estoy perdiendo mi mente,
Estoy perdiendo a mi manera,
Pero yo creo que ella siente que ya estoy atrapado. Dame una oportunidad ...
Pero chica que me pone nervioso,
A estas alturas ya debería haberme dado cuenta.
¿Y qué va a tomar
Para la celestial ...
Me estás volviendo loco! Estribillo:
Porque yo estoy perdiendo mi cabeza,
Estoy perdiendo mi mente,
Estoy perdiendo el control de mí mismo esta vez.
Ella me tiene de perder la cabeza,
Estoy perdiendo mi mente,
Estoy perdiendo a mi manera,
Pero yo creo que ella siente que ya estoy atrapado. [Verse 1:]
I know girl, when you look at me
You don't know how I feel
Cause I'm usually so nonchalant
My feelings I conceal
But I want you to know
Oh, I want you to know I must admit I've felt this way for more than quite a while
But I can't hold it no longer when I see that pretty smile
Can't wait no more
Oh, I can't wait no more Oooh [Chorus:]
Girl, to tell you the truth
It's always been you
I'm all about you
Oh, girl
No one can do me the way you do
It's always been you
I'm all about you [Verse 2:]
Maybe I'm a fool for speaking up but I don't mind
Cause a girl like you will come around like
Once in a million times
So what do I do?
Tell me what do I do And the look that you are givin' me gives me hope to believe
So for you baby I'll change my ways I'll
Wear my heart on my sleeve
Got nothin' to lose
I've got nothin' to lose [Chorus:]
Oh, girl, to tell you the truth
It's always been you
I'm all about you
Oh, girl
No one can do me the way you do
It's always been you
I'm all about you [Bridge:]
Girl when you smile
Not a place I'd rather be
At first I was afraid
I was petrified
I kept thinking I could never live without you
By my side But then I spent so many nights
Just thinking how you've done me wrong
I grew strong
I learned how to get along And so you're back
From outer space
I just walked in to find you
Here without that look upon your face I should have changed that fucking lock
I would have made you leave your key
If I had known for just one second
You'd be back to bother me Well now go,
Walk out the door
Just turn around
Now, you're not welcome anymore Weren't you the one
Who tried to break me with desire?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die? Oh not I,
I will survive
Yeah
As Long as I know how to love, I know I'll be alive
I've got all my life to live
I've got all my love to give
I will survive, I will survive
Yeah, yeah
It took all the strength I had
Just not to fall apart I'm trying hard to mend the pieces
Of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights
Just feeling sorry for myself I used to cry,
But now I hold my head up high
And you see me
With somebody new I'm not that stupid little person
Still in love with you
And so you thought you'd just drop by
And you expect me to be free But now I'm saving all my lovin'
For someone whose lovin' me
Well now go,
Walk out the door Just turn around
Now, you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one
Who tried to break me with desire? Did you think I'd crumple?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?
Oh not I,
I will survive Yeah
As long as I know how to love,
I know I'll be alive
I've got all my life to live I've got all my love to give
I will survive,
I will survive
Yeah, yeah
Oh no I want a girl with a mind like a diamond
I want a girl who knows what's best
I want a girl with shoes that cut
And eyes that burn like cigarettes I want a girl with the right allocations
Who's fast, thorough, and sharp as a tack
She's playing with her jewelry
She's putting up her hair
She's touring the facilities
And picking up slack
I want a girl with a short skirt and a long jacket. I want a girl who gets up early
I want a girl who stays up late
I want a girl with uninterrupted prosperity
Who uses a machete, to cut through red tape With fingernails that shine like justice
And a voice that is dark like tinted glass
She is fast, thorough, and sharp as a tack
She's touring the facilities and picking up slack
I want a girl with a short skirt and a long, long jacket I want a girl with a smooth liquidation
I want a girl with good dividends
At City Bank we will meet accidentally
We'll start to talk when she borrows my pen She wants a car with a cup holder armrest
She wants a car that will get her there
She's changing her name
From Kitty to Karen
She's trading her MG for a white Chrysler LeBaron
I want a girl with a short skirt and a long jacket Reluctantly crouched at the starting line
Engines pumping and thumping in time
The green light flashes, the flags go up
Churning and burning, they yearn for the cup
They deftly maneuver and muscle for rank
Fuel burning fast on an empty tank
Reckless and wild, they pour through the turns
Their prowess is potent and secretly stern As they speed through the finish, the flags go down
The fans get up and they get out of town
The arena is empty except for one man
Still driving and striving as fast as he can
The sun has gone down and the moon has come up
And long ago somebody left with the cup
But he's driving and striving and hugging the turns
And thinking of someone for whom he still burns He's going the distance
He's going for speed
She's all alone (all alone)
All alone in her time of need Because he's racing and pacing and plotting the course
He's fighting and biting and riding on his horse
He's going the distance
No trophy, no flowers, no flashbulbs, no wine
He's haunted by something he cannot define
Bowel-shaking earthquakes of doubt and remorse
Assail him, impale him with monster-truck force
In his mind, he's still driving, still making the grade She's hoping in time that her memories will fade
'Cause he's racing and pacing and plotting the course
He's fighting and biting and riding on his horse
The sun has gone down and the moon has come up
And long ago somebody left with the cup
But he's striving and driving and hugging the turns
And thinking of someone for whom he still burns 'Cause he's going the distance
He's going for speed
She's all alone (all alone)
All alone in her time of need Because he's racing and pacing and plotting the course
He's fighting and biting and riding on his horse
He's racing and pacing and plotting the course
He's fighting and biting and riding on his horse He's going the distance
He's going for speed
He's going the distance Ah no, so sad, alright
Oh no, oh no, no, no Okay, all right, oh no
This one, this one, this one Heads of state who ride and wrangle

Since you wore your pillbox hat
It's been a long time
Since we drove your Po-o-o-o-o-o-ontiac It's been a long time
Since you gave me bu-uh-uh-uh-uh-oo-uh-uh-uh-oo-uh-oo-uh-uh-utterflies

Since I've seen a su-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-unny day You won't admit you love me
And so how am I ever to know?
You only tell me
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps A million times I ask you
And then I ask you over again
You only answer
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps If you can't make your mind up
We'll never get started
And I don't wanna wind up
Being parted, broken hearted So if you really love me, say yes
But if you don't, dear, confess
And please don't tell me
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps If you can't make your mind up
We'll never get started
And I don't wanna wind up
Being parted, broken hearted So if you really love me, say yes
But if you don't, dear, confess
And please don't tell me
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps I need your arms around me
I need to feel your touch
I need your understanding
I need your love so much You tell me that you love me so
You tell me that you care
But when I need you (baby)
Baby, you're never there On the phone
long, long distance
always through such strong resistance
First you say you're to busy
I wonder if you even miss me Never there
You're never there
You're never ever ever ever there A golden bird that flies away
A candle's fickle flame
To think I held you yesterday
Your love was just a game You tell me that you love me so
You tell me that you care
But when I need you (baby)
Baby Take the time to get to know me
If you want me why can't you just show me
Well, always on this roller coaster
If you want me why can't you get closer Never there
You're never there
You're never ever ever ever there
Never there
You're never there
You're never ever ever ever there Ok
Alright
Uh huh

Can cut you from their bloated budgets
Like sharpening knives through Chicken McNuggets...

After this my lungs will be so fucked up
I wish I was in that Mercedes Benz
Sealed away from my sins
I'd have the music high going ninety five Too much

I don't want to worry whether we're going to stay together till we die
I don't want you jumping unless this music's thumping
All the dishes rattle in the cupboards when the elephants arrive I want to love you madly
I want to love you now
I want to love you madly
I want to love you, love you, love you madly I don't want to fake it, I just want to make it
The ornaments look pretty but they're pulling down the branches of the tree
I don't want to think about it, I don't want to talk about
When I kiss your lips I want to sink down to the bottom of the sea I want to love you madly
I want to love you now
I want to love you madly
I want to love you, love you, love you madly I don't want to hold back, I don't want to slip down
I don't want to think back to the one thing that I know I should have done
I don't want to doubt you, know everything about you
I don't want to sit across the table from you wishing I could run I want to love madly
I want to love you now
I want to love you madly
I want to love you, love you, love you madly I'm not feeling alright today
I'm not feeling that great
I'm not catching on fire today
Love has started to fade
I'm not going to smile today
I'm not gonna laugh
You're out living it up today
I've got dues to pay And the gravedigger puts on the forceps
The stonemason does all the work
The barber can give you a haircut
The carpenter can take you out to lunch Now I just want to play on my panpipes
I just want to drink me some wine
As soon as you're born you start dyin'
So you might as well have a good time Sheep go to heaven

That haunts dismembered constellations
A faintly glimmering radio station
While Frank Sinatra sings "Stormy Weather"
The flies and spiders get along together
Cobwebs fall on an old skipping record Beyond the suns that guard this roost
Beyond your flowers of flaming truth
Beyond your latest ad campaigns
An old man sits collecting stamps
In a room all filled with Chinese lamps He saves what others throw away
He says that he'll be rich someday
We know of an ancient radiation
That haunts dismembered constellations
A faintly glimmering radio station

But she had a lighter
I had a flame
But she had a fire
I was bright
But she was much brighter
I was high
But she was the sky Oh baby
I was bound for Mexico
Oh baby
I was bound to let you go I don't know much about Cinco de Mayo
I'm never sure what it's all about
But I say I want you
And you don't believe me
You say you want me
But I've got my doubts Oh baby
I was bound for Mexico
Oh baby

Oh baby
I was bound to let you go (All right) When she walks
She swings her arms
Instead of her hips
When she talks she moves her mouth
Instead of her lips And I've waited for her for so long
I have waited for her for so long
I've wondered if I could hang on
I wonder if I could hang on Let me go she said
Let me go she said
Let me go and I will want you more
Let me go, let me go
Let me go and I will want you When she wants, she wants the sun
Instead of the moon
When she sees, she sees the stars
Inside of her room And I've waited for her for so long
I have waited for her for so long
I've wondered if I could hang on
I wonder if I could hang on Let me go she said
Let me go she said
Let me go and I will want you more

Will turn their backs on you
You'll lose your hair, your teeth
Your knife will fall out of its sheath
But you still don't like to leave
Before the end of the movie People you hate
Will get their hooks into you
They'll pull you down, you'll frown
They'll tie you and drag you through town
But you still don't like to leave
Before the end of the movie
No, you still don't like to leave

The man on the street might just as well
The man on the street might just as well be Launching loony thoughts into the bending of your mind
You reach for something high but it's a mountain that you find
He's a king dust demon with an icepick smile
His music fills your feathers as you feel your passions fly With the mustache man on the carpet of his van
You can feel your fatty tissues giving way to sweaty hands
And the woofers keep distorting and the tweeters kiss the girls
His horn-rimmed glasses lights a square beneath his curls I have wasted so much time
I have wasted so much time He is like a politician who is practicing a speech
He is racing, he is pacing, he is sleeping on his beat
As the sky begins to darken and the waves begin to roll
You can feel the oceans rising as you're losing all control And meanwhile back at the Candlerock Lounge
It is past 11:30 and your friends are getting down
They're applying purple eyeshadow, drinking warm beer
They're wondering where you went to when you told them you'd be here I have wasted so much time
I have wasted so much time I have wasted so much time
I have wasted so much time [Instrumental] You've painted up your lips and rolled, and curled your tinted hair
Ruby are you contemplating going out somewhere?
The shadow on the wall tells me the sun is going down
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town It wasn't me that started this whole crazy Asian war
But I was proud to go and do my patriotic chore
Yes, it's true that I'm not the man I used to be
Oh Ruby, I still need some company It's hard to love a man whose legs are bent and paralyzed
And the wants and the needs of a woman your age, Ruby, I realize
But it won't be long, I've heard them say until I'm not around
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town She's leaving now 'cause I just heard the slamming of the door
The way I know I've heard it slam one hundred times before
And if I could move I'd get my gun and put her in the ground
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town
Oh Ruby, for God sakes turn around No phone No phone I just want to be alone today
No phone no phone
Ringing stinging Jerking like a nervous bird
Rattling up against his cage
Calls to me throughout the day
See the feathers fly No phone No phone I just want to be alone today
No phone No phone
No phone no phone I just want to be alone today Rhyming chiming got me working all the time
Gives me such a worried mind
Now I don't want to seem unkind
But god (it's such a crime) No phone No phone I just want to be alone today
No phone no phone
No phone No phone I just want to be alone today
No phone no phone Shaking quaking
Waking me when I'm asleep
Never lets me go too deep
Summons me with just one beep
The price we pay is steep
I've been on fire
And yet I've still stayed frozen
So deep in the night
My smooth contemplations will always be broken
My deepest concerns will stay buried and unspoken No I don't have any change but here's a few subway tokens
No phone No phone I just want to be alone today
No phone No phone
No phone no phone I just want to be alone today
No phone no phone
No phone No phone I just want to be alone today
No phone No phone I'm so sick of you
so sick of me
I don't want to be with you I'm so sick of you
so sick of me
I don't want to be with you I want to fly away
I want to fly away I'm so sick of work
so sick of play
I don't need another day I'm so sick of work
so sick of play
I don't need another day I need to fly away
I need to fly away Every shiny toy
That at first brings you joy
Will always start to cloy and annoy Every camera every phone
All the music that you own
Won't change the fact you're all alone (All alone!) Every piece of land
every city that you plan
will crumble into tiny grains of sand Every thing you find that at first gives you shine
always turns into the same old crime (Same old crime!) I want to fly away
I want to fly away
I need to fly away
I need to fly away (I'm so sick of you
so sick of me
I don't want to be with you)
(I'm so sick of you
so sick of me
I don't want to be with you) Every little dance
Every hidden back romance
All alone (All alone!) In a wooden boat in the shipping lanes
With the freighters towering over me
I can hear the jets flying overhead
Making lines across the darkening sky And when the sun is going down I can take a taxi into town
And the waiter at the restaurant sets a table just for one
Wheels keep on spinning round spinning round spinning round
Wheels keep on spinning round spinning round and round So I had a plane to take me to a place so far away from you
Eventually we began to see that we could be completely free
And I could get away from you
And you could get away from me
And we could live each separately in our cities in the sun
Wheels keep on spinning round spinning round spinning round
Wheels keep on spinning round spinning round and round In a CD karaoke bar
By the banks of the mighty Bosphorus
Is a Japanese man in a business suit singing "Smoke Gets In Your Eyes"
And the muscular cyborg German dudes dance with sexy French Canadians
While the overweight Americans wear their patriotic jumpsuits Wheels keep on spinning round spinning round spinning round
Wheels keep on spinning round spinning round and round
(Spinning round) Wheels keep on spinning round spinning round spinning round
Wheels keep on spinning round spinning round and round
(Spinning round) (I don't know)
Why you say you are not in love with me
(I don't know)
Why you say you are not in love with me
(I don't know) It's coming down
It's coming down
It's raining outside
You've nowhere to hide She's asking you why you think it's funny
It's coming down
It's coming down
She's leaving your house She had to get out
She's mad and she'll take her mattress with her
It's coming down
It's coming down It's coming down
It's coming down
It's coming down
It's coming down It's coming down
It's coming down
It's coming down
You lie on the floor She's slamming your door
She's gone and she's wearing your red sweater
It's coming down
It's coming down It's coming down
It's coming down
It's coming down
It's coming down Aw no
It's coming down
It's coming down
It's coming down Well your CD collection looks shiny and costly.
How much did you pay for your bad Moto Guzzi?
And how much did you spend on your black leather jacket?
Is it you or your parents in this income tax bracket? Now tickets to concerts and drinking at clubs
Sometimes for music that you haven't even heard of.
And how much did you pay for your rock'n'roll t shirt
That proves you were there That you heard of them first?
How do you afford your rock'n'roll lifestyle?
How do you afford your rock'n'roll lifestyle?
How do you afford your rock'n'roll lifestyle? Ah, tell me.
How much did you pay for the chunk of his guitar,
The one he ruthlessly smashed at the end of the show?
And how much will he pay for a brand new guitar, One which he'll ruthlessly smash at the end of another show?
And how long will the workers keep building him new ones?
As long as their soda cans are red, white, and blue ones.
And how long will the workers keep building him new ones? As long as their soda cans are red, white, and blue ones.
Aging black leather and hospital bills,
Tattoo removal and dozens of pills.
Your liver pays dearly now for youthful magic moments, But rock on completely with some brand new components.
How do you afford your rock'n'roll lifestyle?
How do you afford your rock'n'roll lifestyle?
How do you afford your rock'n'roll lifestyle? Excess ain't rebellion.
You're drinking what they're selling.
Your self-destruction doesn't hurt them.
Your chaos won't convert them. They're so happy to rebuild it.
You'll never really kill it.
Yeah, excess ain't rebellion.
You're drinking what they're selling. Excess ain't rebellion.
You're drinking,
You're drinking,
You're drinking what they're selling. Man is born, man lives, and man dies

You get on, you go around, standing in the saddle Man is born, man lives, and man dies
And it's all vanity. He tried thrills
He said i gave myself to enjoy pleasure
What are teenagers doing today?
They're trying every thrill there is in the books.
We got color TV.
But it is still isn't satisfying. Man is born, man lives, and man dies
And it's all vanity. You can't understand it
It's going so loud and so forth
And they're a-wigglin' and a-wobblin' around
And everything else
And, and, and yet they're not satisfied
And, and these disc jockeys,
They hear the tune that is different. Man is born, man lives, and man dies
And it's all vanity. You can't understand it
It's going so loud and so forth
And they're a-wigglin' and a-wobblin' around
And everything else
And, and, and yet they're not satisfied
And, and these disc jockeys,
They hear the tune that is different.
They hear the tune that is different. Man is born, man lives, and man dies

He can show you his tattoos

In the one true edge
By fastening your safety belts

End is the only part of the word
That I heard
Call me morbid or absurd
But To me

Friend is a four letter word
End is the only part of the word

But To me
Coming from you
Friend is a four letter word
When I go fishing
for the words
I am wishing you would say to me,
I am really only praying that
The words you'll soon be saying
Might betray The way you feel about me
But to me,
Coming from you,
Friend is a four letter word I've got wheels of polished steel
I've tires that grab the road
I've got seats that selflessly hold my friends
And a trunk that can carry the heaviest of loads I've got a mind that can steal me to your house
And a heart that can bring you red flowers
My intentions are good and earnest and true
But under my hood is internal combustion power
And Satan is my motor
Hear my motor purr
Satan is my motor
Hear my motor purr
Satan is the only one who seems to understand I've got brakes I'm wide awake
I can stop this car at any time
At the very last second I can change directions
Turn completely around if I feel so inclined I've got a mind that can steal me to your house
And a heart that can bring you red flowers
My intentions are good and earnest and true
But under my hood is internal combustion power
And Satan is my motor
Hear my motor purr
Satan is my motor
Hear my motor purr
Satan is the only one who seems to understand
Satan is my motor When you tried to kiss me
I only bit your tongue.
When you tried to get me together
I only came undone.
When you tried to tell me
The one for me was you,
I was in your mattress back in 1982. Daria, I won't be soothed.
Daria, I won't be soothed over like,
Smoothed over like milk,
Silk, a bedspread, or a quilt,
Icing on a cake,
Or a serene translucent lake.
Daria, Daria, Daria,
I won't be soothed.
I won't be soothed. When you tried to tell me
Of all the love you had,
I was cleaning oil from beaches
Seeing only what was bad.
When you tried to feed me
I only shut my mouth.
Food got on your apron
And you told me to get out. Daria, I won't be soothed.
Daria, I won't be soothed over like,
Smoothed over like milk,
Silk, a bedspread, or a quilt,
Icing on a cake,
Or a serene translucent lake.
Daria, Daria, Daria,
Daria, Daria, Daria,
Daria, I won't be soothed.
I won't be soothed. Dis empowered, the scattering flock
Dances in a fever at the castle rock
Dust-devil cypress and ripening fruit
Ascending quick into the author's bathroom Fawn, Jo and Tootsie are out on a wire
Lettuce-toothed junkies all full of desire Meanwhile, Rick James takes her nude
And there's nothing I can do
Meanwhile, Rick James takes her nude And there's nothing I can do
And there's nothing I can say to you
I've got a lot of work to do
I guess I'll leave it up to you Uninvited, we'll stay if we want
Searching through your closets for your grandfather's gun
We will swim in your kidney, kidney-shaped pool
Scratching at the bottom for another clue, yeah Fawn, Jo and Tootsie are out on a wire
Lettuce-toothed junkies all full of desire Meanwhile, Rick James takes her nude
And there's nothing I can do
Meanwhile, Rick James takes her nude
And there's nothing I can do (Meanwhile, Rick James takes her nude)
And there's nothing I can say to you
(Meanwhile, Rick James takes her nude) And there's nothing I can do
And there's nothing I can say to you
I've got a lot of work to do
I guess I'll leave it up to you There's a long line of cars
And they're trying to get through
There's no single explanation
There's no central destination But this long line of cars
Is trying to get through
And this long line of cars
Is all because of you
You don't wonder where we're going
Or remember where we've been
We've got to keep this traffic
Flowing and accept a little spin So this long line of cars
Will never have an end
And this long line of cars
Keeps coming around the bend
From the streets of sacramento
To the freeways of L.A.
We've got to keep this fire burning
And accept a little gray
So this long line of cars
Is trying to break free
And this long line of cars
Is all because of me This long line of cars
Long line of cars
Long line of cars
Long line of cars She's writing she's writing she's writing a novel
She's writing she's weaving conceiving a plot
It quickens it thickens you can't put it down now
It takes you it shakes you it makes you lose your thought
But you're caught in your own glory
You are believing your own stories
Writing your own headlines
Ignoring your own deadlines
But now you've gotta' write them all again. You think she's an open book
But you don't know which page to turn to
Do you
You think she's an open book
But you don't know which page to turn to
Do you [Repeat: x2]
You want her, confront her, just open your window
Unbolt it, unlock it, unfasten your latch
You want it, confront it, just open your window
All you really have to do is ask
But you're caught in your own glory
You are believing your own stories
Timing your contractions
Inventing small contraptions
That will roll across your parlor's hardwood floors [Chorus[
You think she's an open book
But you don't know which page to turn to
Do you
You think she's an open book
But you don't know which page to turn to
Do you [Repeat: x2]
You think she's an open book
But you don't know which page to turn to
Do you [Repeat: x3] I am an opera singer
i stand on painted tape
It tells me where I'm going
And where to throw my cape
I call my co-stars brother
I call my co-stars name
I play both good and evil parts
I sing to Verdi's grave And every single morning
By 10 a.m I'm dressed
My rehearsals last for hours and hours
With diligence I have been blessed
Some people, they call me monster
Some people, they call me saint
My talent feeds my darker side
Yet no-one will complain I am an opera singer
I sing in foreign lands
I've sung for Kings in Europe
And Emperors in Japan And after each performance
People stand around and wait
Just to tell me that they loved my voice
Just to tell me that I'm great
I am an opera singer
I will sing when you're all dead
I sing the mountains crumbling apart
I sing what can't be said Heads of state who ride and wrangle
Who look at your face, from more than one angle
Can cut you from their bloated budgets
Like sharpened knives through chicken Mc Nuggets Now heads of state who ride and wrangle
Who look at your face from more than one angle
Can cut you from their bloated budgets
Like sharpened knives through chicken Mc Nuggets Shut the fuck up
Shut the fuck up
Learn to buck up
Shut the fuck up
Learn to buck up Now nimble fingers that dance on numbers
Will eat your children and steal your thunder
While heavy torsos that heave and hurl
Who crunch like nuts in the mouths of squirrels Now nimble fingers that dance on numbers
Will eat your children and steal your thunder
While heavy torsos that heave and hurl
Who crunch like nuts in the mouths of squirrels Shut the fuck up
Shut the fuck up
Learn to buck up
Shut the fuck up
Learn to buck up Now simple feet that flicker like fire
And burn like candles in smoky spires
Do more to turn my joy to sadness
Than somber thoughts of burning planets Now clever feet that flicker like fire
And burn like candles in smoky spires
Do more to turn my joy to sadness
Than somber thoughts of burning planets Your pentagram is down below our floor.
Your naked body shimmers in the night.
Dancing and chanting in a sacrificial rite.
Your feet are dry with the ashes from dead babies
Who have passed the test just like all the rest
But never really understood the reasons why
They took it in the first place.
Ah in the first place.
Your feisty eyes won't make me fall apart.
Your turquoise and silver won't weaken this old heart.
Yeah, dancing and chanting in a sacrificial rite.
I fell to the ground on a windy, windy night.
Well I have passed the test just like all the rest,
But never really understood the reasons why
I took it in the first place.
Ah, in the first place.
Well I have passed the test just like all the rest,
But never really understood the reasons why
I took it in the first place.
Ah, in the first place. In the brown shag carpet of a cheap motel
In the dark and dusty corner by the TV shelf
Is a small reminder of a simpler time
When a crumpled up pair of trousers cost a brand new dime Well you ask me how I made it through?
And how my mint condition could belong to you?
When I'm on the ground, I roll through town
I'm a president you don't remember getting kicked around I'm a dime
I'm fine
And I shine, I'm freshly minted
I am determined not to be dented
By a car or by a plane or anything not yet invented I'm a dime
I'm fine
And I shine In the hiss and rumble of the freeway sounds
As the afternoon commuters drive their cars around
There's a ringle jingle near the underpass
There's a sparkle near the fast food garbage and roadside trash I'm a dime
I'm fine
And I shine, I'm freshly minted
I'm silver plated, I'm underrated
You won't even pick me up
Because I'm not enough for a local phone call I'm a dime
I'm fine
And I shine
I'm a dime
I'm fine
And I shine
I'm a dime
I'm fine
And I shine I don't want to hear you whisper
I don't want to orbit your world of two There's only room for you
In your world of two I don't like to hang around you
I don't want to live in your world of two There's only room for you
In your world of two It's not that I don't like you
But it's not that I don't love you
It's not that I don't think you are
Two of the most
Perfectly
Beautiful
People in your world In your world of two
There's only room for you
In your world of two

There's only room
For you Without the pretty pink ribbon
You'd end up just like me
Without the pretty pink ribbon
You'd float down to the sea Without the pretty pink ribbon
You'd say just what you please
Without the sticky little kitten
Your ticket could never be free Without the tight little denim
Your virtues would all go unknown
Without the room that you live in
Your cancer would eat to the bone Your muscles would bulge underground
Your demons would all be around
Without the pretty pink ribbon
You'd end up just like me Without the pretty pink ribbon
You'd end up just like me
Without the pretty pink ribbon
You'd burn all these dying leaves Without the pretty pink ribbon
You'd lift this steaming herd
You would kill all the sick ones
You would bury them deep in the earth Without the tight little denim
Your virtues would all go unknown
Without the room that you live in
Your cancers would eat to the bone Your muscles would bulge underground
Your demons would all be around
Without the pretty pink ribbon
You'd end up just like me Stickshifts and safetybelts
Bucket seats have all got to go
When we're driving in the car
It makes my baby seem so far I need you here with me
Not way over in a bucket seat
I need you to be here with me
Not way over in a bucket seat But when we're driving in my Malibu
It?s easy to get right next to you
I say, "Baby, scoot over, please"
And then she's right there next to me I need you here with me
Not way over in a bucket seat
I need you to be here with me
Not way over in a bucket seat Alright
Well a lot of good cars are Japanese
Yeah, but when we're driving far I need my baby
I need my baby next to me Well, stickshifts and safetybelts
Bucket seats have all got to go
When we're driving in the car
It makes my baby seem so far I need you here with me
Not way over in a bucket seat
I need you to be here with me

Like she'd done one hundred times before.
Jolene smoothed her dark hair in the mirror.
She folded the towel carefully and put it back in place. Yeah I want to pull you down into bed.
I want to cast your face in lead.
Well every time I pull you close
Push my face into your hair Cream rinse and tobacco smoke
That sickly scent is always always there.
Jolene heard her father's uneven snores.
Right then she knew there must be something more. Jolene heard the singing in the forest.
She opened the door quietly and stepped into the night.
Yeah I want to throw you out into space.
I want to do whatever it takes, takes, takes. You keep pushing me away
In spite of what you say
I found out yesterday that I've
Been wasting all my time Trying to make you smile
Trying to make this seem worthwhile
You've been pushing me around
In spite of what I do
Trying to make things good for you Take your economy car and your suitcase
Take your psycho little dogs
Take it all away You've been racing through my mind
You're picking up in speed
You're driving recklessly
It's like a car crash happening on my street Broken bodies at my feet
And sirens on the way They're too late
'Cause nobody's going to save us
We're a rubbernecker's dream
We're burning gasoline Go
Take your economy car and your suitcase
Take your psycho little dogs
Take it all away And go
Go ahead and destroy this
Better come with an army
Are you feeling, feeling okay, baby? Uh huh
Na na
Na na, na na, na
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na na Take your economy car and your suitcase
Take your psycho little dogs
Take it all away Cool blue reason empties on the page
Your colleagues are in prison and your enemies in reign
Cool blue reason comes into your world
There's two more dead in Texas and it's probably your girls
Cool blue reason wraps around your throat
The minutes change like seasons
Only eight more hours to go Cool blue reason comes into your life
There's one more dead in Kansas and it's probably your wife
Cool blue reason I'm just talking to myself
Cool blue reason I'm just rearranging Hell
I'm just talking to myself
I'm just talking to myself Cool blue reason wraps around your throat
The minutes change likes seasons
Only eight more hours to go
Only eight more hours to go
Only eight more hours left to go Generals gathered in their masses
Just like witches at black masses
Evil minds that plot destruction
Sorcers of death's construction
In the fields the bodies burning
As the war machine keeps turning
Death and hatred to mankind
Poisoning their brainwashed minds
Oh lord, yeah! Politicians hide themselves away
They only started the war
Why should they go out to fight
They leave that role to the poor
Yeah
Time will tell them they have power minds
Making war just for fun
Treating like people just like pawns in chess
Wait until that judgment day comes
Yeah!
(Hey!)
(Hey!)
(Hey!)
(Hey!) Now in darkness world stops turning
As you hear the bodies burning
No more war pigs have the power
And as god has struck the hour
They have judgment
God is calling
On their knees the war pigs crawling
Making mercies for their sins
Satan laughing spreads his wings
Oh lord, yeah! A mirror image of a silver sky,
nests of pines and brandy wines, build this country to the sky
Do you remember now, the oblivion of youthful minds,
caught up in the fashions of their time...
Roll away,
I can see that clearly now, every time I look into this
mirror image of a silver sky,
nests of pines and brandy wine, build this country to the sky
What would they say?
God is here in this country by the sky
A mirror image of a silver sky,
nests of pines and brandy wines, build this country to the sky
Piecemeal of yesteryear,
a stained glass moment marking time,
with full intent on my 22 year old mind
Roll away,
I can see that clearly now,
every time I look into this mirror image of a silver sky,
nests of pines and brandy wine, build this country to the sky
What would they say?
God is here in this country by the sky The winter's chill chilled me to the bone this year
And something in my mind just got away
Being in the places where we used to be
Somehow being there without you's not the same. Parking lots, office parks and shopping malls
And all you left were bills you hadn't paid.
The winter's chill chilled me to the bone this year
And something in my mind just got away It's all behind you now,
You're moving on.
They'll never find you now,
You're moving on, on, on.
Nah nah nah nah nah nah, naa
Nah nah nah nah nah nah, naa Alcohol, cigarettes and luxury goods,
Christmas lights look desperate in this room.
Winter's light left me in the dark last night
And Jingle Bells are smothered in this gloom. Winter's trees freezing in the bitter wind
And autumn's leaves have all been blown away.
Being in the places where we used to be
Somehow being there without you's not the same. It's all behind you now,
You're moving on.
They'll never find you now,
You're moving on, on, on.
Nah nah nah nah nah nah, naa
Nah nah nah nah nah nah, naa It's all behind you now,
You're moving on.

Could someday beat as one
But then the third heart came along
And now our love is gone
I count the many times I've said
I love no one but you
But don't be fooled by
Counting dreams that never will come true Subtract one love, and multiply the heartaches
Divide the tears by every time a heart breaks
The answer only tells us that it's too late
Subtract one love, and multiply the heartache Subtract one love, and multiply the heartaches
Divide the tears by every time a heart breaks
The answer only tells us that it's too late
Subtract one love, and multiply the heartaches
Subtract one love, and multiply the heartaches Who draws the crowd, who plays so loud?
Baby, it's the guitar man
Who's gonna steal the show, you know?
Baby, it's the guitar man He can make you love
He can make you cry
He will break you down
An' he will get you high And something keeps him going
Miles and miles away
To find another place to play And night after night, who treats you right?
Baby, it's the guitar man
And who's on the radio, you know?
Baby, it's the guitar man When he comes to town
And you see his face
And you think you might
Like to take his place Something keeps him drifting
Miles and miles away
Searching for the songs to play Then you listen to the music and you'd like to sing along
And you want to get the meaning out of each and every song
And you find yourself a message and some words to call your own
And take 'em home [Incomprehensible]
Ya
Ohh, ho He can make you love
He can get you high
And he will bring you down
He will make you cry Something keeps him moving
But no one seems to know
What it is that makes him go? Then the lights being to flicker and the sound is getting dim
The voice begins to falter and the crowds are getting thin
But he never seems to notice
He's just gotta find another place to play Anyway
Got to play
Anyway
Aaa aaa
... You have always got to move,
You're always trying to prove that,
There is something new in,
Everything you do. You are mostly in your car,
You always seem so far,
No matter where you are,
You're thinking of your car, And everything you say,
Is really just a play,
For you to get your way,
And I found out yesterday,
That no matter what you say,
And no matter what you do,
That you have got to... You have always got to move,
You're racing just to prove that,
There is something new,
In everything you do. You are mostly on the phone,
You say you're coming home,
You say you're all alone,
But I know you're not alone. And everything you say,
Is really just a play,
For you to get your way,

You'd never have believed it
When the house was standing
You'd never have believed
The bricks and mortar, have all given way
At first, they resisted, but then they began to sway How can you say, forever, is at your command?
How can you say, the future's in the palm, in the palm of your hand? When the house was standing
You'd never have believed it
When the house was standing
You'd never have believed
That gaping hole, was, once a foundation
Where you stand now were tools in a basement and How can you say, forever, is at your command?
How can you say, the future's in the palm, in the palm of your hand? You won't admit you love me
And so how am I ever to know?
You only tell me
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps A million times I ask you
And then I ask you over again
You only answer
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps If you can't make your mind up
We'll never get started
And I don't wanna wind up
Being parted, broken hearted So if you really love me, say yes
But if you don't, dear, confess
And please don't tell me
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps If you can't make your mind up
We'll never get started

Watching the sun set
I'll never forget
Watching all the reds and oranges slip away
Letting go of yet another dirty day Breathing in the fumes from so many idling cars
Right beneath the sign with the dusty yellow stars
Watching the sun go down
Watching the sun go down
Watching the sun, the sun
Watching the sun go down Standing in the Alpha Beta parking lot
Watching you leave me
Not quite believing
Standing in the Alpha Beta parking lot
Watching the sun set
I'll never forget Breathing in the fumes from so many idling cars
Right beneath the sign with the dusty yellow stars
Watching the sun go down
Watching the sun go down
Watching the sun, the sun

The same ones that I'm drowning in
You lead your casual slaughters
And I'm the one who helps you win
You've got your grand piano You don't even play piano
I'm the one who plays piano
You don't even play piano
You part the waters The same ones that I'm thirsty for
You invite your friends to tea
But when it's me you lock the door
You've got your credit cards And you thank your lucky stars.
But don't forget the ones who foot the bill
You've got your grand piano
And you don't even play piano I can't believe it's true, I can't believe that you
Don't want me anymore
You're with him and you don't even know That I've been dying all day long
And singing sad, sad songs
And wishing you were gone Ha, is this love?
Oh, is this love?
Is this love?
Or should I close the door? Yea, my eyes are burning in my head
And seeing only red
And wishing you were dead Is this love?
Oh, is this love?

Oh, no is this love? I don't thing so
Is this love?

Should I close the door? Up so close I never get to see your face.
Microscope I might as well be out in space.
Up so close I never get to see the view.
Down your throat I'm never sure if it's still you. Up your nose down to your toes.
In your mouth way down south.
Up so close it seems I only think of you.
Up so close I never see the sky so blue. I only wanted to be sure
That what it was was really pure.
I put my face down in the cake.
My feet were flailing in a lake. Up so close, I never get to see your face.
Microscope, I might as well be out in space.
Up so close, I never get to see you.
Microscope, I'm never sure if it's still you. The land of race car ya-yas

You need to pull back your shoulders and tighten your butt.

If you want to have cities you've got to build roads.
You need to find some new feathers and buy some new clothes.
Just get rid of the antlers and lighten your load.

Do you think it's all just murky green?
Don't you think that she would realize?
Yeah do you think she has never seen?
Cause when the seaweed sinks and the sun gets low
When the waves retire to the darkness below
I know I know Ruby sees all.
I know I know Ruby sees.
I can feel the pressure building high.
You should see you're headed for a storm.
Don't you see it building in the sky?
Don't you think it's time to swim to shore?
Cause when the seaweed sinks and the sun gets low,
When the waves retire to the darkness below,
I know, I know Ruby sees all.
I know, I know Ruby sees all.
I know, I know Ruby sees. At first I was afraid.
I was petrified.
I kept thinking I could never live
Without you by my side.
But then I spent so many nights
Just thinking how you'd done me wrong.
I grew strong.
I learned how to get along.
And so you're back from outer space.
I just walked in to find you here
Without that look upon your face.
I should have changed my fucking lock.
I would have made you leave your key
If I'd have known for just one second
You'd be back to bother me. Go on now go.
Walk out the door.
Just turn around now.
You're not welcome anymore.
Weren't you the one
Who tried to break me with desire?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?
Oh not I. I will survive.
As long as I know how to love
I know I'll be alive.
I've got all my life to live.
I've got all my love to give.
I will survive.
I will survive. It took all the strength I had
Just not to fall apart.
I'm trying hard to mend
The pieces of my broken heart.
And I spent oh so many nights
Just feeling sorry for myself.
I used to cry.
But now I hold my head up high. And you'll see me with somebody new.
I'm not that stupid little person
Still in love with you.
And so you thought you'd just drop by,
And you expect me to be free.
But now I'm saving all my lovin'
For someone who's lovin' me. Go on now go.
Walk out the door.
Just turn around now.
You're not welcome anymore.
Weren't you the one
Who tried to break me with desire?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?
Oh not I. I will survive.
As long as I know how to love
I know I'll be alive.
I've got all my life to live.
I've got all my love to give.
I will survive.
I will survive. I'm writing a song all about you
A true song as real as my tears
But you've no need to fear it
'Cause no one will hear it
Sad songs and waltzes aren't selling this year
I'll tell all about how you cheated
I'd like for the whole world to hear
I'd like to get even
With you 'cause you're leavin'
But sad songs and waltzes aren't selling this year
It's a good thing that I'm not a star
You don't know how lucky you are
Though my record may say it
No one will play it
Sad songs and waltzes aren't selling this year
It's a good thing that I'm not a star
You don't know how lucky you are
Though my record may say it
No one will play it
Sad songs and waltzes aren't selling this year You should've told me when it all began
You should've told me long ago
Someday I know you're gonna find
Just one mistake is not enough to change my mind What's now is now
And I'll forget what happened then
I know it all
And we can still begin again And if the doubting faces made you go
It's only mine that matters now
Those looks will soon begin to fade
If you come back and show them all you're not afraid What's now is now
And I'll forget what happened then
I know it all
And we can still begin again Now that you know how much I understand
You have no reason to be gone
And if you feel at all like me
Just let me know, I'll make it like it used to be What's now is now
And I'll forget what happened then
I know it all
And we can still begin again
What's now is now
And I'll forget what happened then
I know it all (I know it all)
And we can still begin again
What's now is now (now is now) That Italian guy over there
The one with the polyester pinstriped suit
The one with the gray hair and mustache
Must be thinking really loud thoughts
Because he's nodding and squinting and nodding and squinting
And putting down his metal cane
Like he's making a point, and it's very important indeed
Yeah, he's making a point, and it's very important indeed Yeah, he's making a point, and it's very important indeed
Yeah, he's making a point, and it's very important indeed She'll hang the baskets on the walls

Down to our pretty city of stars in our eyes

It would be easy
It would be easy, so easy
It would be easy to crash School teachers, beggars, bankers, Congressmen
Stargazers didn't see a thing
Stockbrokers, singers, dancers, architects

Then they flap their wings at the last second.
You see birds fall from the window ledge above mine.
Then they flap their wings at the last second.
I can see their dead weight
Just dropping like stones
For small loaves of bread
Past my window all the time.
But unless I get up
Walk across the room
And peer down below
I don't see their last second curves
Toward a horizontal flight.
All these birds just falling from the ledge like stones.
Now due to a construct in my mind
That makes their falling and their flight
Symbolic of my entire existence,
It becomes important for me
To get up and see
Their last second curves toward flight.
It's almost as if my life will fall
Unless I see their ascent.

Birds fall from the window ledge above mine.
Then they flap their wings at the last second.
I said birds fall from the window ledge above mine.
Then they flap their wings at the last second.
But unless I get up,
Walk across the room
And peer down below,
I won't see their last second curves
Toward a, a horizontal flight.
All these birds just falling from the ledge like stones.
Now due to a construct in my mind
That makes their falling and their flight
Symbolic of my entire existence,
It becomes important for me
To get up and see
Their last second curves toward flight.
It's almost like my life will fall,
My life will fall,
Unless I see their ascent.

You tear down the bridge
Flimsy as it is,
It's business like.
You shake my hand
You break up the band
Flimsy as it is,
It's open mike
punk rock
Red white and blue,
You twist the knife
Then go home to kiss your wife
A bigger better slice
is what you'd like
You kick the sand
You get the upper hand
You sell it to Japan
It's natural
Punk rock
Red white and blue You turn the screws
It's what you choose to do
You think that I
Must turn them too
You think that I
Must be so satisfied
I stay inside
I wonder why And the cement mixer gets it all ready
One good turn at a time
Then pouring it slowly and steady
You're showing me where I can sign
What I can expect to find
But how you can you say you'll be happy
When you turn the screws You turn the screws
It's what you choose to do
You think that I
Must turn them too
You think that I
Must be so satisfied
I stay inside
I wonder why Excuse Me, I Think I've Got A Heartache
From Wheels-EP (iTunes exclusive) They just don't know how lost I feel without you
My teardrops never see the light of day
I laugh and joke and paint a bright tomorrow
But if I told the truth I'd have to say... Excuse me, I think I've got a heartache
There's an aching deep inside
And it just won't be denied Excuse me, I think I've got a heartache
And I'd better say goodbye
Before I cry I guess it's pride that makes me hide my sorrow
I live a lie in all I do and say
My lips may lie and paint a bright tomorrow
But if I told the truth I'd have to say... Excuse me, I think I've got a heartache
There's an aching deep inside
And it just won't be denied Excuse me, I think I've got a heartache
And I'd better say goodbye
Before I cry I'm writing a song all about you
A true song as real as my tears
But you've no need to fear it
'Cause no one will hear it
Sad songs and waltzes aren't selling this year
I'll tell all about how you cheated
I'd like for the whole world to hear
I'd like to get even
With you 'cause you're leavin'
But sad songs and waltzes aren't selling this year
It's a good thing that I'm not a star
You don't know how lucky you are
Though my record may say it
No one will play it
Sad songs and waltzes aren't selling this year
It's a good thing that I'm not a star
You don't know how lucky you are
Though my record may say it
No one will play it
Sad songs and waltzes aren't selling this year Strangers in the night,
Exchanging glances
Wandering the night,
What were the chances
We'd be sharing love
Before the night was through Something in your eyes
Was so inviting
Something in your smile
Was so exciting
Something in my heart
Told me I must have you Strangers in the night
Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment
When we said our first hello
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away And ever since that night
We've been together
Lovers at first sight
In love forever
It turned out so right I'm sitting by the window of your 32nd floor apartment
Waiting for your phone calls all to end
I'm sitting, watching wind blow, watching time go, watching cars go by
I'm waiting for these memories to begin If I threw my guitar
Out the window so far down
Would I start to regret it?
Or would I smile and watch it slowly fall, fall, fall? Garbage trucks and taxi cabs don't seem like they can reach me here
The clamor of jackhammers seems so faint
Well the way you treat me like the only slightly brings me down a lot
I don't think that I'll ever be the same If I threw my guitar
Out the window so far down
Would I start to regret it?
Or would I smile and watch it slowly fall, fall, fall? Keep on, keep on doing it
Right on, right on doing it
Baby, keep on Right on
Keep on doing it
Now my baby keep on
Keep on, keep on Wherever, wherever girl, I'll do it
Forever and ever, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'll see you through it I've got to keep you pleased
In every way I can
Gonna give you all of me
As much as you can stand Make love to you right now
That's all I want to do
I know you need it, girl
And you know I need it, too 'Cause I found
What the world is searching for
Here, right here, my dear
I don't have to look no more And, oh, my babe
I hoped and I prayed
For someone just like you
To make me feel the way you do I'm never, never gonna give ya up
I'm never, ever gonna stop
Not the way I feel about you
Girl, I just can't live without you I'm never ever gonna quit
'Cause quittin' just ain't my shtick
I'm gonna stay right here with you
Do all the things you want me to Whatever you want
Girl, you got it
And whatever you need
I don't want to see you without it You've given me much more
Than words could ever say
And oh, my dear, I'll be right here
Until my dying day I don't know just how to say
All the things I feel
I just know that I love you so
And it gives me such a thrill 'Cause I found
What this world is searching for
Here, right here, my dear
I don't have to look no more And all of my days
I hoped and I prayed
For someone just like you
To make me feel the way you do I'm never, never gonna give ya up
I'm never, ever gonna stop
Stop the way I feel about you
Girl, I just can't live without you I'm never ever gonna quit
'Cause quittin' just ain't my shtick
I'm gonna stay right here with you
Do all the things you want me to Oh, I'm never gonna give ya up
I'm never, ever gonna stop
All the things I feel about you
Girl, I just can't live without you I'm never ever gonna quit
'Cause quittin' just ain't my shtick Just stay for a while
Then you'll see you should be right here with me
Cause I love everything you do
That's why I have to take this time baby to tell ya
Oh, and now you know
And now you know [Chorus:]
Girl, to tell you the truth
It's always been you
I'm all about you
Oh, girl
No one can do me the way you do
It's always been you
I'm all about you Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'm all about you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'm all about you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'm all about you girl
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh I've been down that road before
And I ain't goin' back And don't you brag to me
That you never read a book
I never put my faith
In a con man and his crooks I won't follow down that path
And tempt the hands of fate
Aw, let's turn this thing around
Before it gets too late [Chorus]
It's up to me and you
Love can conquer hate
I know this to be true
That's what makes us great In the quiet of the night
I lie here wide awake
And I ask myself
Is there a difference I can make? [Chorus]
It's up to me and you
Love can conquer hate
I know this to be true
That's what makes us great Build your dreams to the stars above
But when you need someone to love
Don't go to strangers, darling, come to me Play with fire till your fingers burn
And when there's no place for you to turn
Don't go to strangers, darling, come to me For, when you hear a call to follow your heart
You'll follow your heart I know
I've been through it all, for I'm an old hand
And I'll understand if you go So
Make your mark for your friends to see
But when you need more than"Don't worry about a thing,

You might want to sing it note for note
Don't worry be happy
In every life we have some trouble
When you worry you make it double
Don't worry, be happy...... Ain't got no place to lay your head
Somebody came and took your bed
Don't worry, be happy
The land lord say your rent is late
He may have to litigate
Don't worry, be happy
Look at me I am happy
Don't worry, be happy
Here I give you my phone number
When you worry call me
I make you happy
Don't worry, be happy
Ain't got no cash, ain't got no style
Ain't got no girl to make you smile
But don't worry be happy
Cause when you worry
Your face will frown
And that will bring everybody down
So don't worry, be happy (now)..... There is this little song I wrote
I hope you learn it note for note
Like good little children
Don't worry, be happy
Listen to what I say
In your life expect some trouble
But when you worry
You make it double
Don't worry, be happy......
Don't worry don't do it, be happy
Put a smile on your face
Don't bring everybody down like this
Don't worry, it will soon pass
Whatever it is
Don't worry, be happy One love, one heart
Let's get together and feel all right
Hear the children crying (One love)
Hear the children crying (One heart)
Sayin', "Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel all right
Sayin', "Let's get together and feel all right
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa Let them all pass all their dirty remarks (one love)
There is one question I'd really love to ask (one heart)
Is there a place for the hopeless sinner
Who has hurt all mankind just to save his own?
Believe me One love, one heart
Let's get together and feel all right
As it was in the beginning (one love)
So shall it be in the end (one heart)
Alright, give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel all right
Let's get together and feel all right
One more thing Let's get together to fight this Holy Armageddon (one love)
So when the Man comes there will be no, no doom (one song)
Have pity on those whose chances grow thinner
There ain't no hiding place from the Father of Creation Sayin', one love, one heart
Let's get together and feel all right
I'm pleading to mankind (one love)

So I've got to push on through.

Who are you to judge me
And the life that I live?
I know that I'm not perfect
And that I don't claim to be.
So before you point your fingers,
Be sure your hands are clean. Judge not
Before you judge yourself.
Judge not
If you're not ready for judgement. Woah oh oh! The road of life is rocking
And you may stumble too.
So while you talk about me,
someone else is judging you. (Saxophone solo) Judge not
Before you judge yourself.
Judge not
If you're not ready for judgement. Woah oh oh! The road of life is rocky
And you may stumble too.

Dis a war That until that day
The dream of lasting peace,

Will remain in but a fleeting illusion to be pursued,
But never attained

Have been toppled
Utterly destroyed

I see your face
It's haunting me
I guess I need you baby I make-believe

You seem to move on easy Every time I try to fly I fall
Without my wings

I guess I need you baby
And every time I see
You in my dreams
I see your face
You're haunting me
I guess I need you baby I may have made it rain
Please forgive me
My weakness caused you pain
And this song's my sorry At night I pray
That soon your face will fade away Every time I try to fly I fall
Without my wings
I feel so small
I guess I need you baby
And every time I see
You in my dreams
I see your face
You're haunting me
I guess I need you baby You tell me you're in love with me
Like you can't take your pretty eyes away from me

I, I'm stronger Lately I've been stuck imagining
What I wanna do and what I really think
Time to blow out Be a little inappropriate
'Cause I know that everybody's thinking it
When the light's out Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa Lately people got me all tied up
There's a countdown waiting for me to erupt
Time to blow out I've been told do what you do with it
We keep both my hands above the blanket
When the light's out Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa Baby, I'm so into you
You've got that something, what can I do
Baby, you spin me around, oh
The earth is movin', but I can't feel the ground
Every time you look at me
My heart is jumpin', it's easy to see
Loving you means so much more
More than anything I ever felt before [Chorus]
You drive me crazy
I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Crazy, but it feels alright
Baby thinkin' of you keeps me up all night
Tell me, you're so into me
That I'm the only one you will see
Tell me I'm not in the blue, oh
That I'm not wastin'
My feelins on you
Loving you means so much more
More than anything I ever felt before
Chorus
Crazy, I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Crazy, but it feels alright
Every day and every night
Chorus Hey, over there
Please, forgive me
If I'm comin' on too strong
Hate to stare
But, you're winnin'
And they're playin' my favorite song
So, come here
A little closer
Wanna whisper in your ear
Make it clear
A little question
Wanna know just how you feel If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?
'Cause, you feel like paradise
And I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me? Hey, you might think
That I'm crazy
But, you know I'm just your type
I might be
Little hazy
But, you just cannot deny
There's a spark
In between us
When we're dancin' on the floor
I want more
Wanna see it
So, I'm askin' you tonight If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?
'Cause, you feel like paradise
And I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me? If I said I want your body
Would you hold it against me?
Yeah, uh-huh, oh Give me somethin' good
Don't wanna wait
I want it now
Pop it like a hood
And show me how you work it out Alright
If I said my heart was beating loud
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me? If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?
'Cause, you feel like paradise
And I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me? I used to think
I had the answers to everything
But now I know
That life doesn't always
Go my way, yeah
Feels like I'm caught in the middle
That's when I realize I'm not a girl
Not yet a woman
All I need is time
A moment that is mine
While I'm in between
I'm not a girl There is no need to protect me
It's time that I
Learn to face up to this on my own
I've seen so much more than you know now
So don't tell me to shut my eyes I'm not a girl
Not yet a woman
All I need is time
A moment that is mine
While I'm in between
I'm not a girl But if you look at me closely
You will see it in my eyes
This girl will always find
Her way (I'm not a girl)
I'm not a girl don't tell me what to believe
(Not yet a woman)
I'm just tryin' to find the woman in me, yeah
(All I need is time) all I need is time
(A moment that is mine) that's mine
While I'm in between I'm not a girl
Not yet a woman
All I need is time (is all I need)
A moment that is mine
While I'm in between I'm not a girl
Oh

Wipe the floor with all the boys
Pour the drinks, bring the noise (It's Iggy-Iggs!)
We're just so pretty!
All around the world, pretty girls
Jump the line, to the front
Do what we like, get what we want (Where you at, Brit?)
We're just so pretty! Hey, don't you know that it's always the same?
From Australia 'round to LA
You can betcha', wherever the girls go, boys follow
We be keeping them up on their toes
They can laugh, but they don't get the jokes
Just you watch, they're so predictable
(Some things don't change) (The girls roll up)
Windows roll down
(Eyes on us)
Jaws on the ground
(Watch them go)
It's just so funny
(Like bees to the honey!) All around the world, pretty girls
Wipe the floor with all the boys
Pour the drinks, bring the noise
We're just so pretty!
All around the world, pretty girls
Jump the line, to the front
Do what we like, get what we want
We're just so pretty! Tell me, is it true that these men are from Mars?
Is that why they be acting bizarre?
Every time I walk out of my house it's like, "hey, baby!"
They don't see me rolling my eyes
They buzzing around me like flies
They got one thing on their minds
(Some things don't change) (The girls roll up)
Windows roll down
(Eyes on us)
Jaws on the ground
(Watch them go)
It's just so funny
(Like bees to the honey!) All around the world, pretty girls
Wipe the floor with all the boys
Pour the drinks, bring the noise
We're just so pretty!
All around the world, pretty girls
Jump the line, to the front
Do what we like, get what we want
We're just so pretty! If you ask me, I'm killing them softly
I would spend time with you but that'd cost me
They pray that Iggy-Iggy give 'em one more chance
But busy Iggy wouldn't even give 'em one more glance
See, enter in line between the beauty and a beast
Slim waist, thick cake, the whole world want a piece
Bad girl, good (ooh) would make you lose your mind
All of the boys begging Britney, hit 'em one more time
Iggs! All around the world, pretty girls
Wipe the floor with all the boys
Pour the drinks, bring the noise
We're just so pretty!
All around the world, pretty girls
Jump the line, to the front
Do what we like, get what we want
We're just so pretty! Never look back, we said
How was I to know I'd miss you so?
Loneliness up ahead, emptiness behind
Where do I go? And you didn't hear
All my joy through my tears
All my hopes through my fears
Did you now, still I miss you somehow From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
You were my first love
You were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose
From the bottom of my broken heart
Even though time may find me somebody new
You were my real love, I never knew love
'Til there was you
From the bottom of my broken heart Baby, I said
Please stay, give our love a chance for one more day
We could have worked things out
Taking time is what love's all about But you put a dart through my dreams
Through my heart
And I'm back where I started again
Never thought it would end From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
You were my first love,
You were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose
From the bottom of my broken heart
Even though time may find me somebody new
You were my real love, I never knew love
'Til there was you
From the bottom of my broken heart You promised yourself
But to somebody else
And you made it so perfectly clear
Still I wish you were here now From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
You were my first love
You were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose From the bottom of my broken heart
Even though time may find me somebody new
You were my real love, I never knew love
'Til there was you
From the bottom of my broken heart Never look back, we said
How was I to know I'd miss you so? For whatever reason
I feel like I've been wanting you all my life
You don't understand?
I'm so glad we're at the same place
At the same time, it's over now
I spotted you dancing
You made all the girls stare
Those lips and your brown eyes
And the sexy hair
I should shake my thing
I make the world want you
Tell your boys you'll be back
I wanna see what you can do What would it take for you to just leave with me?
Not trying to sound conceited
But me and you we're meant to be
You're a sexy guy, I'm a nice girl (don't you know?)
Let's turn this dance floor into our own little nasty world Boys, sometimes a girl just needs one (you know I need you)
Boys, to love her and to hold (I just want you to touch me)
Boys, and when a girl is with one
Boys, then she's in control Took the boy off the dance floor
Screaming in his ear
Must have said something 'bout me (what you say?)
Because he's looking over here
You looking at me with a sexy attitude
But the way your boys moving it
It puts me in the mood What would it take for you to just leave with me?
Not trying to sound conceited
But me and you were meant to be (don't you know?
You're a sexy guy, I'm a nice girl (don't you know?)
Let's turn this dance floor into our own little nasty world Boys, sometimes a girl just needs one (I get nasty)
Boys, to love her and to hold (I get nasty)
Boys, and when a girl is with one (I get nasty)
Boys, then she's in control (You like that? Here we go) Tonight, let's fly, boy have no fear (have no fear)
There's no time to lose (What are you waiting for?)
And next week, you may not see me here
So, boy, just make your move (let me see what you can do) Boys, sometimes a girl just needs one

And I don't want to be so damn protected There must be another way
Cause I believe in taking chances

What a girl is to do?
God, I need some answers What am I to do with my life?

How am I supposed to know what's right?
(You just got to do it your way)
I can't help the way I feel
But my life has been so overprotected I'll tell them what I like, what I want, what I don't
But every time I do I stand corrected
Things that I've been told
I can't believe what I hear about the world, I realize
I'm overprotected There must be another way
Cause I believe in taking chances
But who am I to say
What a girl is to do?

(You just got to do it your way)
I can't help the way I feel
But my life has been so overprotected There's a girl in the mirror
I wonder who she is
Sometimes I think I know her
Sometimes I really wish I did There's a story in her eyes
Lullabies and goodbyes
When she's looking back at me
I can tell her heart is broken easily 'Cause the girl in my mirror
Is crying out tonight
And there's nothing I can tell her
To make her feel alright Oh the girl in my mirror
Is crying 'cause of you
And I wish there was something
Something I could do If I could
I would tell her
Not to be afraid
The pain that she's feeling The sense of loneliness will fade
So dry your tears and rest assured
Love will find you like before
When she's looking back at me
I know nothing really works that easily 'Cause the girl in my mirror
Is crying in tonight
And there's nothing I can tell her
To make her feel alright Oh the girl in my mirror
Is crying 'cause of you
And I wish there was something
I wish there was something
Oh I wish there was something
I could do I can't believe it's what I see
That the girl in the mirror
The girl in the mirror
Is me I can't believe what I see (no....)
(The girl in my mirror)
The girl in my mirror is me
Ohh... is me 'Cause the girl in my mirror

(You like it)
(Now watch me) Get it get it, get it get it (oh)
Get it get it, get it get it (oh)
Get it get it, get it get it (oh) I really wanna dance, tonight with you
(I just can't help myself)
I really wanna do what you want me to
(I just feel I let myself go) I really wanna dance, tonight with you
(Wanna see you move)
I really wanna do what you want me to
(Uh uh uh) Baby, don't you wanna, dance up on me
(I just wanna dance next to you)
To another time and place
Oh, baby, don't you wanna, dance up on me
(Are you ready)
Leaving behind my name, and age I'm a slave for you (take that) I cannot hold it, I cannot control it
I'm a slave (it just feels right) for you (it just feels good)
I won't deny it, I'm not trying to hide it (baby) Get it get it, get it get it (oh)

I cannot hold it, I cannot control it
I'm a slave for you, (here we go) I won't deny it, (yeah)
I'm not trying to hide it (Like that) There was a time I was one of a kind
Lost in the world out of me myself and I
Was lonely then like an alien
I tried but I never figured it out
Why I always felt like a stranger in a crowd
Ooh that was then like an alien But the stars in the sky look like home, take me home
And the light in your eyes lets me know I'm not alone Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone Crossed through the universe to get where you are
Travel the night riding on a shooting star
Was lonely then like an alien
Had to get used to the world I was on
While yet still unsure if I knew where I belong
Ooh That was then like an alien But the stars in the sky look like home, take me home
And the light in your eyes lets me know I'm not not alone Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone But the stars in the sky look like home, take me home
And the light in your eyes lets me know I'm not alone Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
(Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone - not alone not alone not alone) Ya!
Yeah... Aay, shorty.
(Britney giggles) You're so sweet Britney:
Stranger, A stranger
Candy from a stranger Excuse ma, but you're sick
sweeter than a Hershey Kiss
Come, be my desert in this
I put my spoon in your dip
Oooh!
We got one night only
Hope you brought some jolly ranchers for me
Then she told me; Britney:
I don't even know you But here, I got a snicker for you, here! [Chorus:]
Britney:
What's in front of me?, I just can't believe
Oh, you're tempting me
(Oh oh 'cause you're so sweet)
It's been too long
Oh, it feels so wrong
Danger, Danger, candy from a stranger You don't need to sugar coat it
I got it, and you know it
All of the pieces with it
(mama told me don't) Take candy from strangers
Candy from strangers
Candy from a stranger Shorty, have a bite
I will fill your appetite
I know your mom said not to
But, I'll change your life after tonight
Bet you never tried it, and I guarantee you'll like it
And I know you can't resist, so don't fight it, don't fight it
Come give it to me [Chorus] [Bridge]
Britney:
A stranger Laze:
Come get some Britney:
A stranger Laze:
Just like that
A stranger
Don't be scared, don't be scared [Bridge x2] Mama use to tell me
Don't take candy from a stranger
But girl, you look so sweet
You got me reaching with my fingers
She said don't take candy from a stranger,
candy from a stranger, candy from a stange, a stranger [Chorus x2] Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I think I did it again
I made you believe we're more than just friends
Oh baby
It might seem like a crush
But it doesn't mean that I'm serious
'Cause to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
Oh baby, baby Oops, I did it again
I played with your heart, got lost in the game
Oh baby, baby
Oops, you think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent You see my problem is this
I'm dreaming away
Wishing that heroes, they truly exist
I cry, watching the days
Can't you see I'm a fool in so many ways
But to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
Oh baby, oh Oops, I did it again
I played with your heart, got lost in the game
Oh baby, baby
Oops, you think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah All aboard
Britney, before you go, there's something I want you to have
Oh, it's beautiful, but wait a minute, isn't this?
Yeah, yes it is
But I thought the old lady dropped it into the ocean in the end
Well baby, I went down and got it for you
Aww, you shouldn't have Oops, I did it again to your heart
Got lost in this game, oh baby
Oops, you think that I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent Oops, I did it again
I played with your heart, got lost in the game
Oh baby, baby
Oops, you think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent Oops, I did it again
I played with your heart, got lost in the game
Oh baby, baby
Oops, you think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent Baby, I'm so into you
You got that something, what can I do
Baby, you spin me around
Oh, the earth is moving, but I can't feel the ground Every time you look at me
My heart is jumpin', it's easy to see
Lovin' you means so much more
More than anything I ever felt before You drive me crazy
I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Oh crazy
But it feels alright
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night Oh oh
Tell me, you're so into me
That I'm the only one you will see
Tell me, I'm not in the blue, oh
That I'm not wastin' my feelings on you Lovin' you means so much more
More than anything I ever felt before You drive me crazy
I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Oh crazy
But it feels alright
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night Crazy
I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Crazy
But it feels alright
Every day and every night You drive me crazy (you drive me crazy, baby)
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Oh crazy (you make me feel alright)
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night You drive me crazy (you drive me crazy, baby)
Yeah
Oh crazy (you make me feel alright)
But it feels alright
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night Nothing about you is typical
Nothing about you is predictable
You've got me all twisted and confused
(It's all new)
Up til now, I thought I knew love
Nothing to loose and its damaged cause
Patterns will fall as quick as I do, but now Bridges are burning
Baby I'm learning, a new way of thinking now
Love I can see, nothing will be, just like it was
Is that because? Baby you're so unusual
Didn't anyone tell you, you're supposed to, break my heart?
I expect you do, so why haven't you?
Maybe you're not even human cause
Only an angel can be so unusual
Sweet surprise, I could get used to
Unusual You Been so many things when I was someone else
Boxer in the ring trying to defend myself
In the private eye to see what's going on
(That's long gone)
When I'm with you, I can just be myself
You're always where you said you will be
Shocking cause I never knew love like this could exist Tables are turning
My heart is soaring, You'll never let me down
Answer my call, here after all
Never met anyone like you Baby you're so unusual
Didn't anyone tell you, you're supposed to, break my heart?
I expect you do, so why haven't you?
Maybe you're not even human cause
Only an angel can be so unusual
Sweet surprise, I could get used to
Unusual You Can't believe that I almost didn't try
When you call my name
Now everything has changed Baby you're so unusual
Didn't anyone tell you, you're supposed to, break my heart?
I expect you do, so why haven't you?
Maybe you're not even human cause
Only an angel can be so unusual
Sweet surprise, I could get used to
Unusual You Said you're gonna be here in a minute
Sitting in the mirror, getting pretty
Gotta look my best if we gonna break up
Gotta look my best if we gonna break up
I can hear you knocking at the front door
And I know exactly what you came for
Trying to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy
Trying to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy You
Touch me and it's breaking me down
And me down, and me down, and me down
I'm telling you, let's just give it up
And get down, and get down, and get down So come on
Won't you give me something to remember?
Baby, shut your mouth and turn me inside out

How you shook my world and flipped it upside down
You're the only one who ever drove me crazy
'Cause you know me inside out
Inside out I know that we probably shouldn't do this
Wake up in the morning feeling stupid
Said that we were done but you're all up on me
Said that we were done but you're all up on me

Guess I gotta get you out my system
Trying to let you go but it's not that easy
Trying to let you go but it's not that easy You

And I will pull through, oh no yeah When you let go
Of all youve known

You will see so clear
It will bring tears to your eyes
Maybe everything will be alright
So let go
You gotta let go Ive got a feeling
Right now
You feel it too
Oh, oh
This little song
Might be the one
That will tell us what to do
Oh, oh, ooh, ooh These tears are overflowing
And never knowing why
All these years weve been
Weve been hurting
We have to look inside
And try
To let go You gotta let go
To love, you gotta let go
If you really wanna love
You gotta let go French fingertips,
Red lips
Bitch is dangerous
Cotton candy kiss
Can't wait for my sugar rush Can't take it no more
I got to have more tonight
This feeling's so strong
I'm putting you on tonight Alright, let's go! Baby take a seat
Eyes on me this is my show
Your one and only pleasure
All decked in lace and leather
Fantasy, courtesy of me
Baby let's go
Watch me apply the pressure
All decked in lace and leather Heels 6 inch
Makes a boy wanna bite his lip
Look but don't touch
Unless you want to lose your innocence Can't take it no more
I got to have more tonight
This feelings so strong
I'm putting you on tonight Baby take a seat
Eyes on me this is my show
Your one and only pleasure
All decked in lace and leather
Fantasy, courtesy of me
Baby let's go
Watch me apply the pressure
All decked in lace and leather Baby take a seat
Eyes on me this is my show
Your one and only pleasure
All decked in lace and leather
Fantasy, courtesy of me
Baby let's go
Watch me apply the pressure
All decked in lace and leather Breathe you out
Breathe you in
You keep coming back to tell me
You're the one who could have been
And my eyes see it all so clear
It was long ago and far away but it never disappears
I try to put it in the past
Hold on to myself and don't look back I don't wanna dream about
All the things that never were
Maybe I can live without
When I'm out from under
I don't wanna feel the pain
What good would it do me now
I'll get it all figured out
When I'm out from under
(From under, from under, from under, from under) So let me go
Just let me fly away
Let me feel the space between us growing deeper
And much darker every day
Watch me now and I'll be someone new
My heart will be unbroken
It will open up for everyone but you
Even when I cross the line
It's like a lie I've told a thousand times I don't wanna dream about
All the things that never were
Maybe I can live without
When I'm out from under
I don't wanna feel the pain
What good would it do me now
I'll get it all figured out
When I'm out from under
(From under, from under, from under, from under) And part of me still believes
When you say you're gonna stick around
And part of me still believes
We can find a way to work it out
But I know that we tried everything we could try
So let's just say goodbye
Forever I don't wanna dream about
All the things that never were
Maybe I can live without
When I'm out from under
I don't wanna feel the pain
What good would it do me now
I'll get it all figured out
When I'm out from under
(From under, from under, from under, from under) I don't wanna dream about
All the things that never were
Maybe I can live without
When I'm out from under
I don't wanna feel the pain
What good would it do me now
I'll get it all figured out
When I'm out from under
(From under, from under, from under, from under) From under, from under, from under, from under. I'm not ashamed of the things that I dream
I find myself flirting with the verge of obscene
Into the unknown, I will be bold
I'm going to places I can be out of control And I don't want to explain tonight
All the things I've tried to hide
I shut myself out from the world so I
Can draw the blinds and I'll teach myself to fly I love myself
It's not a sin
I can't control what's happenin' 'Cause I just discovered
Imagination's taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand From the small of my back and the arch of my feet
Lately I've been noticin' the beautiful me
I'm all in my skin and I'm not gonna wait
I'm into myself in the most precious way And I don't want to explain tonight
All the things I've tried to hide
I shut myself out from the world so I
Can draw the blinds and I'll teach myself to fly 'Cause I just discovered
Imagination's taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand There's a world undefined
And my body is mine
I won't be left behind
I'm already here 'Cause I just discovered
Imagination's taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand 'Cause I just discovered
Imagination's taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand Do you feel this
I know you feel this
Are you ready?
I don't think so Somebody give me my truck
So I can ride on the clouds
So I can turn up the bass like Somebody pass my guitar
So I can look like a star
And spend this cash like What'chu gonna do when the crowd goes a-yo?
Why you standin' on the wall?
Music startin' everywhere

Don't go to strangers, darling, come to me Tonight you're mine, completely
You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
Will you love me tomorrow Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic of your sighs
Will you still love me tomorrow Tonight with words unspoken
You said that I'm the only one, the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning star I'd like to know that your love
Is a love I can be sure of
So tell me now, 'cause I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow He left no time to regret
Kept his dick wet
With his same old safe bet
Me and my head high
And my tears dry
Get on without my guy
You went back to what you knew
So far removed from all that we went through
And I tread a troubled track
My odds are stacked
I'll go back to black We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to
I go back to us I love you much
It's not enough
You love blow, and I love puff
And life is like a pipe
And I'm a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to Black
Black
Black
Black
Black
Black
Black
I go back to
I go back to We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to black You should be stronger than me
You've been here seven years longer than me
Don't you know you supposed to be the man?
Not pale in comparison to who you think I am
You always want to talk it through, I don't care
I always have to comfort you when I'm there
But that's what I need you to do, stroke my hair
'Cause I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, and you my lady boy You should be stronger than me
But instead you're longer than frozen turkey
Why'd you always put me in control
All I need is for my man to live up to his role
You always want to talk it through, I'm okay
I always have to comfort you every day
But that's what I need you to do, are you gay?
'Cause I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, and you my lady boy He said "the respect I made you earn
Thought you had so many lessons to learn"
I said "You don't know what love is get a grip
Sound as if you're reading from some other tired script"
I'm not gonna meet your mother anytime
I just want to grip your body over mine
Please tell me why you think that's a crime
I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, and you my lady boy You should be stronger than me
You should be stronger than me
You should be stronger than me
You should be stronger than me They tried to make me go to rehab
I said, no, no, no
Yes, I been black
But when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time
And if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab
I won't go, go, go I'd rather be at home with a Ray
I ain't got seventy days
'Cause there's nothing, there's nothing you can teach me
That I can't learn from Mr. Hathaway I didn't get a lot in class
But I know we don't come in a shot glass They tried to make me go to rehab
I said, "no, no, no"
Yes, I been black
But when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time
And if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab
I won't go, go, go The man said, "why do you think you here?
I said, I got no idea.
I'm gonna, I'm gonna lose my baby
So I always keep a bottle near
He said, I just think you're depressed
This, me, yeah, baby, and the rest They tried to make me go to rehab
But I said, no, no, no
Yes, I been black
But when I come back, you'll know, know, know I don't ever want to drink again
I just, oh, I just need a friend
I'm not gonna spend ten weeks
Have everyone think I'm on the mend And it's not just my pride
It's just till these tears have dried They tried to make me go to rehab
I said, no, no, no
Yes, I been black
But when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time
And if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab
I won't go, go, go Well sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doing
And in my head I paint a picture 'Cause since I've come on home,
Well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over Valerie? Valerie
Valerie
Valerie Did you have to go to jail,
Put your house up for sale, did you get a good lawyer?
I hope you didn't catch a tan,
I hope you'll find the right man who'll fix it for ya
And are you shopping anywhere,
Changed the color of your hair, are you busy?
And did you have to pay that fine
You were dodging all the time, are you still dizzy? 'Cause since I've come on home,
Well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over Valerie? Valerie
Valerie
Valerie Well sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doing
And in my head I paint a picture 'Cause since I've come on home,
Well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over Valerie? Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie Why don't come over Valerie? Meet you downstairs in the bar and heard
Your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt
You say, "Why did you do it with him today?"
And sniff me out like I was Tanqueray 'Cause you're my fella, my guy
Hand me your Stella and fly
By the time I'm out the door
You tear me down like Roger Moore I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
You know that I'm no good Upstairs in bed with my ex-boy
He's in the place, but I can't get joy
Thinking of you in the final throes
This is when my buzzer goes Run out to meet your chips and pitter
You say when we're married 'cause you're not bitter
There'll be none of him no more
I cried for you on the kitchen floor I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
You know that I'm no good Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain
We're like how we were again
I'm in the tub, you're on the seat
Lick your lips as I soak my feet Then you notice little carpet burn
My stomach drops, and my guts churn
You shrug, and it's the worst
To truly stuck the knife in first I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
You know that I'm no good
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
Yeah, ya know that I'm no good All I can ever be to you is a darkness that we knew
And this regret I got accustomed to
Once it was so right
When we were at our height
Waiting for you in the hotel at night
I knew I hadn't met my match
But every moment we could snatch
I don't know why I got so attached
It's my responsibility
You don't owe nothing to me
But to walk away, I have no capacity He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown
And in your way
In this blue shade
My tears dry on their own I don't understand
Why do I stress the man
When there's so many bigger things at hand?
We could've never had it all
We had to hit a wall
So this is inevitable withdrawal
Even if I stop wanting you
And perspective pushes through
I'll be some next man's other woman soon
I cannot play my self again
I should just be my own best friend
Not fuck my self in the head with stupid men He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown
And in your way
In this blue shade
My tears dry on their own So we are history
Your shadow covers me
The sky above ablaze He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown
And in your way
In this blue shade
My tears dry on their own I wish I could sing no regrets
And no emotional debt
'Cause as we kissed goodbye, the sun sets
So we are history
Your shadow covers me
The sky above ablaze
That only lovers see He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown
And in your way
My blue shade
My tears dry on their own Whoa, he walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown
And in your way
My deep shade
My tears dry on their own He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown
And in your way
My deep shade
My tears dry For you I was the flame
Love is a losing game
Five story fire as you came
Love is losing game One I wished, I never played
Oh, what a mess we made
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game Played out by the band
Love is a losing hand
More than I could stand
Love is a losing hand Self-professed profound
Till the chips were down
Know you're a gambling man
Love is a losing hand Though I battled blind
Love is a fate resigned
Memories mar my mind
Love is a fate resigned Over futile odds
And laughed at by the gods
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game It's okay in the day
I'm staying busy
Tied up enough so I don't have to wonder where is he
Got so sick of crying
So just lately
When I catch myself, I do a one-eighty
I stay up, clean the house
At least I'm not drinking
Run around just so I don't have to think about thinking
That silent sense of content
That everyone gets
Just disappears 'soon as the sun sets He's fierce in my dreams, seizing my guts
He floats me with dread
Soaked in soul
He swims in my eyes by the bed
Pour myself over him
Moon spilling in
And I wake up alone If I was my heart
I'd rather be restless
The second I stop, the sleep catches up
And I'm breathless
'Cause this ache in my chest
As my day is done now
The dark covers me, and I cannot run now
My blood running cold
I stand before him (before him, I)
It's all I can do to assure him (assure him)
When he comes to me
I drip for him tonight
Drowning in me, we bathe under blue light He's fierce in my dreams, seizing my guts
He floats me with dread
Soaked in soul
He swims in my eyes by the bed
Pour myself over him
Moon spilling in
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone Tonight you're mine, completely
You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
Will you love me tomorrow Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic of your sighs
Will you still love me tomorrow Tonight with words unspoken
You said that I'm the only one, the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning star I'd like to know that your love
Is a love I can be sure of
So tell me now, 'cause I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow There I go, there I go, there I go, there I go
Pretty baby you are the soul, snaps my control
Such a funny thing but every time your near me
I never can behave
You give me a smile and I'm wrapped up in your magic
There's music all around me
Crazy music, music that keeps calling me so
Very close to you, turns me into your slave
Come on and do with me any little thing that you want to
Anything, baby just let me get next to you So am I insane or do I really see heaven in your eyes?
Bright as stars that shine up above you
In the clear blue sky, how I worry 'bout you
Just can't live my life without you
Baby come here, don't have no fear
Oh, is there wonder why
I'm really feeling in the mood for love So tell me why, stop to think about this weather, my dear
This little dream might fade away
There I go talking out of my head again baby won't you
Come and put our two hearts together
That would make me strong and brave
Oh, when we are one, I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
Now if there's a cloud up above us
Go on and let in rain
I'm sure our love together would endure a hurricane
Oh my baby won't you please let me love you
And get a release from this awful misery What is all this talk about loving me, my sweet
I am not afraid, not anymore, not like before
Don't you understand me, now baby please
Pull yourself together, do it soon
My soul's on fire, come on and take
I'll be what you make me, my darling Oh baby, you make me feel so good
Let me take you by the hand
Come let us visit out there
In that new promised land Maybe there we can find
A good place to use a lovin' state of mind
I'm so tired of being without it
And never known what love's about
James Moody would you come on hit me,
You can blow now if you want to, I'm through Nobody stands in between me and my man
It's me and Mr. Jones (me and Mr. Jones) What kind of fuckery is this?
You made me miss the Slick Rick gig (oh, Slick Rick)
And thought I didn't love you when I did (when I did)
Can't believe you played me out like that (ah) No, you ain't worth guest list
Plus one of all them girls you kiss (all them girls)
You can't keep lying to yourself like this (to yourself)
Can't believe you played yourself (out) like this Ruler's one thing, but come Brixton
Nobody stands in between me and my man
'Cause it's me and Mr. Jones (me and Mr. Jones) What kind of fuckery are we?
Nowadays you don't mean dick to me (dick to me)
I might let you make it up to me (make it up)
Who's playing Saturday? What kind of fuckery are you?
'Side from Sammy, you're my best black Jew
But I could swear that we were through (we were through)
I still want to wonder 'bout the things you do Mr. Destiny, nine and fourteen
Nobody stands in between me and my man
'Cause it's me and Mr. Jones
Yeah (me and Mr. Jones) (me and Mr. Jones) There's a saying old
Says that love is blind
Still we're often told
"Seek and ye shall find"
So I'm going to seek
A certain lad
I've had in mind Looking everywhere
Haven't found him yet
He's the big affair
I cannot forget
Only man I ever think
Of with regret I'd like
To add his initial
To my monogram
Tell me
Where is the shepherd
For this lost lamb? There's a somebody
I'm longin' to see
I hope that he turns
Out to be
Someone to watch over me I'm a little lamb
Who's lost in the wood
I know I could
Always be good
To one
Who'll watch over me Although he may
Not be the man some
Girls think
Of as handsome
To my heart
He carries the key Won't you tell him please
To put on some speed
Follow my lead
Oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me Won't you tell him please
To put on some speed
Follow my lead
Oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me
Someone to watch over me When will we get
The time to be
Just friends? It's never safe for us
Not even in the evening
'Cause I've been drinking
Not in the morning
When your shit works
It's always dangerous
When everybody's sleeping
And I've been thinking
Can we be alone?
Can we be alone? When will we get
The time to be
Just friends?
When will we get
The time to be
Just friends? And, no, I'm not ashamed
But the guilt will kill you
If she don't first
I'll never love you like her
Thought we need to find a time
To just do this shit together
'Fore it gets worse
I want to touch you
But that just hurts When will we get
The time to be
Just, just friends?
When will we get
The time to be
Just friends, just friends? When will we get
The time to be
Just friends, just friends?

And I'll send all my loving to you I'll pretend that I'm kissing
The lips that I am missing
And hope that your dreams will come true And then while I'm away

All my loving, darling I'll be true
All my loving, all my loving
Ooh, all my loving, all my loving, I will send to you Her name is Cherry, we've just met
But already she knows me better than you
She understands me after eighteen years
And you still don't see me like you ought to do Maybe we could talk 'bout things
If you was made of wood and strings
While I love her every sound
I dunno how to turn you down And you're so thick and my patience thin
So I got me a new best friend
With a pickup that puts you to shame
And Cherry is her name And when I'm lonely, Cherry's there
And she plays along while I sing out my blues
I could be crying and you don't care
You won't call me back, you're stubborn as a mule Maybe we could talk 'bout things
If you was made of wood and strings
You might think I've gone too far
I'm talking 'bout my new guitar Wish I could say it breaks my heart
Like you did in the beginning
Its not that we grew apart
A nightingale no longer singing Its something I know you can't do
Separate sex with emotion
I sleep alone the sun comes up
Your still clinging to that notion Every thing is slowing down
River of no return
Recognize my every sound
There is nothing new to learn You'll never get my mind right
Like two ships passing in the night
In the night, in the night
Want the same thing where we lay
Otherwise mines a different way
A different way from where I'm going
Oh, its you again listen this isn't a reunion
So sorry if I turn my head
Yours is a familiar face
But that don't make your place safe
In my bed, my bed, my bed I never thought my memory
Of what we had could be intruded
But I couldn't let it be
I needed it as much as you did Now its not hard to understand
Why we just speak at night
The only time I hold your hand
Is to get the angle right
Everything is slowing down
River of no return
You recognize my every sound
There's nothing new to learn You'll never get my mind right
Like two ships passing in the night
In the night in the night
Want the same thing where we lay
Otherwise mine's a different way
A different way from where I'm going
Oh, its you again listen this isn't a reunion
So sorry if I turn my head
Yours is a familiar face
But that don't make your place safe
In my bed, my bed, my ba ba dee dee bed When you walk in the bar
And you dressed like a star
Rockin' your f me pumps
And the men notice you
With your Gucci bag crew
Can't tell who he's lookin' to 'Cause you all look the same
Everyone knows your name
And that's you whole claim to fame
Never miss a night
'Cause your dream in life
Is to be a footballer's wife You don't like players
That's what you say-a
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire
You don't like ballers
They don't do nothing for ya
But you'd love a rich man six foot two or taller You're more than a fan
Lookin' for a man
But you end up with one-night-stands
He could be your whole life
If you got past one night
But that part never goes right In the morning you're vexed
He's onto the next
And you didn't even get no taste
Don't be too upset
If they call you a skank
'Cause like the news everyday you get pressed You don't like players
That's what you say-a
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire
Or them big baller
Don't do nothing for ya
But you'd love a rich man six foot two or taller You can't sit down right
'Cause you jeans are too tight
And your lucky its ladies night
With your big empty purse
Every week it gets worse
At least your breasts cost more than hers So you did Miami
'Cause you got there for free
But somehow you missed the plane
You did too much E
Met somebody
And spent the night getting cane Without girls like you
There'd be no fun
We'd go to the club and not see anyone
Without girls like you
There's no nightlife
All those men just go home to their wives Don't be mad at me
'Cause you're pushing thirty
And your old tricks no longer work
You should have known from the jump
That you always get dumped
So dust off your fuck me pumps Brother
There's so much that I could never say to your face
Bye, bye now
You should know the world and all its ways so find your place How do I find words that do not condescend
When she bore you before me
'Cause she doesn't need a child, she needs a friend
A son not a sob story (Now you must have never heard of what she did for you)
And your priority, it must be heard
(Now you must have never heard of what she did for you)
'Cause we'll never be the way we were She can't always be there just to hold you down
Our mother
When you are at a age now well life turns around
My brother Realize that you don't have to answer to no man
Responsibility comes down to you
But how can I expect you to understand
When you live life like its so run through (Now you must have never heard of what she did for you)
Your priority, it must be heard
(Now you must have never heard of what she did for you)
'Cause we'll never be the way we were (Now you must have never heard of what she did for you)
And your priority, it must be heard
(Now you must have never heard of what she did for you)
'Cause we'll never be the way we were The way we were, we'll never be
And your priority, it must be heard Build your dreams to the stars above
But when you need someone to love
Don't go to strangers, darling, come to me Play with fire till your fingers burn
And when there's no place for you to turn
Don't go to strangers, darling, come to me For, when you hear a call to follow your heart
You'll follow your heart I know
I've been through it all, for I'm an old hand
And I'll understand if you go So
Make your mark for your friends to see
But when you need more than company
Don't go to strangers, darling, come to me Whoa, oh
Oh, whoa, oh He can only hold her for so long
The lights are on, but no one's home
She's so vacant
Her soul is taken
He thinks, What's she running from? Now, how can he have her heart
When it got stole?
So he tries to pacify her
'Cause what's inside her never dies Even if she's content in his warmth
She is plagued with urgency
Searching kisses
The man she misses
The man that he longs to be Now, how can he have her heart
When it got stole?
So he tries to pacify her
'Cause what's inside her never dies So he tries to pacify her
'Cause what's inside her it never dies So he tries to pacify her
But what's inside her never dies Lent you outsiders and my new Badu
While you were thinking I didn't have a clue
Tough to sort files with your voice in my head
So then I bribed you downstairs with a Marlboro Red, uh huh And now I feel so small discovering you knew
How much more torture would you have put me through?
You probably saw me laughing at all your jokes
Or how I did not mind when you stole all my smokes, yeah And although my pride is not easy to disturb, yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
With your battered jeans and your Beasties tee
Now I can't work like this, with you next to me And although he's nothing in the scheme of my years
It just serves to bludgeon my futile tears
And I'm not use to this, no no, I observe yeah, I don't chase
But now I'm stuck with consequences, thrust in my face, yeah
And the melodramas of my day delivery blows
And that surpass your rejection, it just goes to show
A simple attraction that reflects right back to me
So I'm not as into you as I appear to be Although my pride, yeah, is not easily disturbed
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
With your battered jeans, yeah and your Beasties tee, yeah yeah
Now I can't work like this, no with you next to me yeah yeah His message was brutal but the delivery was kind
Maybe if I get this down, I'll get it off my mind, yeah
Oh it serves to condition me and smoothen my kinks
Despite my frustration for the way that he thinks
And I knew the truth, when it came, would be to that effect
At least you're attracted to me which I did not expect
Didn't think you'd get my number down as such
But I never hated myself, for my age so much, yeah And although my pride's, yeah, not easy to disturbed, yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb, yeah
So with your battered jeans, yeah, and your Beasties tee
Now I can't work like this, no, with you next to me, yeah And although my pride's, yeah, not easy to disturbed, yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
So with your battered jeans yeah and your Beasties tee
Now I can't work like this, no, with you next to me To know know know him

Just to see that smile
Makes my life worthwhile To know know know him

Just to see that smile
Makes my life worthwhile To know know know him
Is to love love love him
And I do
I really do
And I do I don't catch your drift and I don't catch your plan
Need to get my thoughts down but it's getting late
Need to get up now, get my feet on the ground
But the show is so unprepared now My place so messed up, I tried on some shoes
Should think clear and focus but I've things to do
Glancing at my CD rack, eyes linger on Frank
And I must put that check in the bank Try to put me in a room, distraction less
(Everything is everything)
Spare me from worse
In the studio I will finally burn
(All the time is all you got)
Tempted to work Always got something to do, someone to be seeing
Somewhere to be dancing, I'm a wake human being
It's an opportunity, shout till you go blue
Unless I wanna do it, your words go through Need to buy some cigarettes, can't put it off any longer
Worked appeal depression, I feel it growing stronger
Maybe when I'm all grown up, I will get it through
But right now I got stuff to do Try to put me in a room, distraction less
(Everything is everything)
Spare me from worse
In the studio I would finally burn
(All the time is all you got)
Tempted to work Put me in a room, distraction less
(Everything is everything)
Spare me from worse
In the studio I would finally burn
(All the time is all you got)
Tempted to work Gotta get this song down before I leave tonight
But my hair, just does it's own thing and I gotta look alright
And I gotta write a chorus but words allude me now
I have to get this down before I leave somehow And anyway I be thinkin' to meet you at the station
Guilty 'cause I should be home, damn procrastination
So when they ask me later, I won't tell them how it's going
But now my head is empty and the work load keeps on growing Try to put me in a room, distraction less
(Everything is everything)
Spare me from worse
In the studio, I would finally burn
(All the time is all you got)
Tempted to work Put me in a room, distraction less
Spare me from worse
In the studio I would finally burn
Tempted to work Distraction less
Spare me from worse
I would finally burn
Tempted to work When I walk in your shoes
I understand a man confused
There must have been but I don't care
I feel the way your soul does there Darling they empathize
Looking through your bloodshot eyes
And I know you you're so frustrated
Above we all become what we once hated
Be slight nobody can be that wise I can't help you if you won't help yourself
No I can't help you if you don't help yourself
You can only get so much from someone yeah
You can get so much from me
I can't help you if you won't help yourself You've got the degree in philosophy
So you think you're cleverer than me
('Cause you so smart)
But I'm not just some drama queen (Drama queen)
'Cause it's where you're at not where you've been
So what do you expect from me
(What do you want) To hold your head above the sea
(Keep you high and dry)
And carry you even though you're bigger
'Cause don't you know you crush my tiny figure And anyway we're still so young
(Yeah I'm so young)
And this isn't yet the day I can't help you if you won't help yourself
No I can't help you if you don't help yourself
(You won't help yourself)
You can only get so much from someone yeah
I can't help you if you won't help yourself You might be twenty-five but in my mind
I see you at sixteen years oh most of the time
And I'm, I'm just a child and you're full grown
And no I'm nothing like I've ever known yeah
You are like nothing that I ever knew I've been so many places in my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs I've made some bad rhyme
I've acted out my love in stages
With ten thousand people watching
But we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you I know your image of me is what I hope to be
I've treated you unkindly but darlin' can't you see
There's no one more important to me
Darlin' can't you please see through me
Cause we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you You taught me precious secrets of the truth withholding nothing
You came out in front and I was hiding
But now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody cause my love is in there hiding I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for in my life you are a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singing this song for you You taught me precious secrets of the truth withholding nothing
You came out in front and I was hiding
But now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody cause my love is in there hiding I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for in my life you are a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singing this song for you
We were alone and I was singing this song for you Understand once he was a family man
So surely I would never, ever go through it first hand
Emulate all the shit my mother hated
I can't help but demostrate my Freudian fate
My alibi for taking your guy
History repeats itself, it fails to die
And animal agression is my downfall
I don't care 'bout what you got I want it all It's bricked up in my head, it's shoved under my bed
And I question myself again: what is it 'bout men?
My destructive side has grown a mile wide
And I question myself again: what is it 'bout men? It's bricked up in my head, it's shoved under my bed
And I question myself again: what is it 'bout men?
My destructive side has grown a mile wide
And I question myself again: what is it 'bout men? Aye aye aye, aye aye aye
Tell you baby, you huggin' up the big monkey man
Aye aye aye, aye aye aye

Huggin' up the big monkey man There is no greater love
Than what I feel for you
No sweeter song, no heart so true There is no greater thrill
Than what you bring to me
No sweeter song
Than what you sing, sing to me You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known
And to think that you are mine alone There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you If my man was fighting
Some unholy war
I would be behind him
Straight shook up beside him
With strength he didn't know
It's you I'm fighting for
He can't lose with me in tow
I refuse to let him go
At his side, and drunk on pride
We wait for the blow Put it in writing
But who you writing for?
Just us on kitchen floor
Justice done
Reciting, my stomach standing still
Like you're reading my will
He still stands in spite of what his scars say
I'll battle till this bitter finale
Just me, my dignity, and this guitar case, whoa, whoa If, if my man is fighting some unholy war
And I will stand beside you
But who you dying for?
B, I would have died too
I'd have liked to
If my man was fighting
Some unholy war
If my man was fighting I couldn't resist him
His eyes were like yours
His hair was exactly the shade of brown
He's just not as tall, but I couldn't tell
It was dark and I was lying down You are everything ' he means nothing to me
I can't even remember his name
Why're you so upset?
Baby, you weren't there and I was thinking of you when I came What do you expect?
You left me here alone; I drank so much and needed to touch
Don't overreact ' I pretended he was you
You wouldn't want me to be lonely How can I put it so you understand?
I didn't let him hold my hand
But he looked like you; I guess he looked like you
No he wasn't you
But you can still trust me, this ain't infidelity
It's not cheating; you were on my mind Yes he looked like you
But I heard love is blind Tonight you're mine, completely
You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
Will you love me tomorrow Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic of your sighs
Will you still love me tomorrow Tonight with words unspoken
You said that I'm the only one, the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning star I'd like to know that your love
Is a love I can be sure of
So tell me now, 'cause I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow I bought you a fur coat when you were fifteen
You wore it to the disco, where everyone was in jeans
But you were just a rich girl, and only having fun
Your worn out dresses, got stares from everyone
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong? You left for London, when you were nineteen
Had to pawn all your nice clothes, just living on dreams
A man in the bright lights took all that you own
Now he's taken your freedom for a date unknown But you were just a rich girl, hardly having fun
Your worn out dresses, brought stares from everyone
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong? Hey, little rich girl you've been away for so long
And now little rich girl, I wrote this song
Hey, little rich girl my love for you is gone
And now little rich girl, I know where you belong At your dad's office party all the movies were blue
You caused him so much heartache, because the screen star was you
You left for London, when you were nineteen
Had to pull off your nice clothes, but you were living on dreams You were a rich girl, and only having fun
But your worn out dresses, brought stares from everyone
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong?
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong? Your neighbors were screaming
I don't have a key for downstairs
So I punched all the buzzers hoping he would be there
And now my head's hurting
You say I always get my own way
But you were in the shower when I got there
And I don' wanted to stay, but I got nothing to say You were so beautiful before today
And then I heard what you say'man that was ugly The Moschino bra you bought me last Christmas
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Frank's in there and I don't care
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Just take it
Take the box Take the box I came home this evening and nothing felt like how it should be
I feel like writing you a letter but that is not me'you know me
Feel so fucking angry, don't want to be reminded of you
But when I left my shit in your kitchen
I said goodbye to your bedroom it smelled of you Mr False Pretence, you don't make sense
I just don't know you
But you make me cry, where's my kiss goodbye'
I think I love you The Moschino bra you bought me last Christmas
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Frank's in there and I don't care
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Now take it
Take the box
Just take it, take it
Take the box
And now just take the box
Take the box Oh, lullaby by birdland that's what i
Always hear, when you sigh,
Never in my wordland could there be words to reveal
In a phrase how i feel Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo, when they love?
That's the kind of magic music we made with our lips
When we kiss And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how i'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye Lullaby by birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet, and we'll go
Flying high in birdland, high in the sky up above
All because we're in love Lullaby, lullaby Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic music we made with our lips
When we kiss And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how i'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye Lullaby by birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet, and we'll go
Flying high in birdland, high in the sky up above
All because we're in love I should care, I should go around weeping
I should care, I should go without sleeping
Strangely enough, I sleep well
'cept for a dream or two
But then I count my sheep well
Funny how sheep can lull you to sleep So I should care, I should let it upset me
I should care but it just doesn't get me
Maybe I won't find someone as lovely as you
But I should care and I do (brief instrumental interlude) I should care but it just doesn't get me
Maybe I won't find someone as lovely as you
But I should care and I do And I do I would die before I divorce you
I'd take a thousand thumps for my love
'Cause you kiss a lucky horseshoe
Stuck it in my boxing glove
'Cause anyone who will see us
Through our victory and done defeat
Knows that I'll take you to the cleaners
If you come between the cheats Between the cheats, ooh oh oh ooh oh oh
Between the cheats, ooh oh oh ooh oh oh My husband is the finest handsome hustler
And he still make this housewife blush
So I'm holding my hand in his
I'm sitting on the royal flush
Women drink him in, swimming in his green eyes
Then go home and catch the chips you got
And take a bad beat to ooh to boat oh!
The jack of hearts is my jackpot Between the cheats, ooh oh oh ooh oh oh
Between the cheats, ooh oh oh ooh oh oh Catch me on, have to ?
And I know as my heart beats
There's a winning secret to both
And it's sworn between the cheats Between the cheats, ooh oh oh ooh oh oh
Between the cheats, ooh oh oh ooh oh oh
Between the cheats, ooh oh oh ooh oh oh Swing back and forth
A beautiful thing taking you away
My head is spinning My girl tried to stop me
But I had a taste of you
Unfamiliar surroundings
Left me wanting something new Physical ain't even my type
But you're one of a kind
So subconsciously on purpose
I left my coat behind I can't help it, need to stop it
All that I put myself through
Everyone is so denying
Yeah, it's nice to meet you, too I hate my alcoholic logic
As I write this on the train
Victoria's Secret in my bag
And my thighs ache again Last night tips into my mind
Through the puddle in my head
I always get what I want
I think I even said I can't help, it need to stop it
All that I put myself through
Everyone is so denying
Yeah, it's nice to meet you, too Although I enjoyed it
I should have tied up my loose ends
But I left my jacket with you
And you know my friends So maybe you will get my number
Or ask them when I'm ached down
But I may have forgotten you
By the next time I'm in town I can't help, it need to stop it
All that I put myself through
Everyone is so denying
Yeah, it's nice to meet you, too Well sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doing
And in my head I paint a picture 'Cause since I've come on home,
Well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over Valerie? Valerie
Valerie
Valerie Did you have to go to jail,
Put your house up for sale, did you get a good lawyer?
I hope you didn't catch a tan,
I hope you'll find the right man who'll fix it for ya
And are you shopping anywhere,
Changed the color of your hair, are you busy?
And did you have to pay that fine
You were dodging all the time, are you still dizzy? 'Cause since I've come on home,
Well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over
Stop making a fool out of me

Straight to my lovers heart for me.
Nobody but me.
Cupid, please hear my cry.
And let your arrow fly.
Straight to my lovers heart, for me Yeah, Cupid.
Oh, Cupid.
Mm mm, Cupid. When you walk in the bar,
And you dressed like a star,
Rockin' your F me pumps. And the men notice you,
With your Gucci bag crew,
Can't tell who he's lookin' to. Cause you all look the same,
Everyone knows your name,
And that's you whole claim to fame. Never miss a night,
Cause your dream in life,
Is to be a footballers wife.
You don't like players,
That's what you say-a,
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire. You don't like ballers,
They don't do nothing for ya,
But you'd love a rich man six foot two or taller. You're more than a fan,
Lookin' for a man,
But you end up with one-nights-stands. He could be your whole life,
If you got past one night,
But that part never goes right. In the morning you're vexed,
He's onto the next,
And you didn't even get no taste. Don't be too upset,
If they call you a skank,
Cause like the news everyday you get pressed. You don't like players,
That's what you say-a,
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire. Or them big ballers,
Don't do nothing for ya.
But you'd love a rich man six foot two or taller, You can't sit down right,
Cause you jeans are too tight,
And your lucky its ladies night. With your big empty purse,
Every week it gets worse,
At least your breasts cost more than hers. So you did Miami,
Cause you got there for free,
But somehow you missed the plane. You did too much E,
Met somebody,
And spent the night getting caned. Without girls like you,
There'd be no fun,
We'd go to the club and not see anyone. Without girls like you,
There's no nightlife,
All those men just go home to their wives. Don't be mad at me,
Cause you're pushing thirty,
And your old tricks no longer work. You should have known from the job,
That you always get dumped,
So dust off your fuck me pumps You're wondering now, what to do, now you know this is the end
You're wondering how, you will pay, for the way you misbehaved First time I swallowed, now you're on your own
I won't return, forever you will wait You're wondering now, what to do, now you know this is the end First time I swallowed, now you're on your own
I won't return, forever you will wait You're wondering now, what to do, now you know this is the end
You're wondering how, you will pay, for the way you misbehaved You're wondering now, what to do, now you know this is the end
You're wondering how, you will pay, for the way you misbehaved
You're wondering now, what to do, now you know this is the end
You're wondering how, you will pay, for the way you misbehaved Simple sweet guitar
Humbled by the bass
So when the beat kicks in
Everything falls into place
And it overpowers me
I can't help but dance
You can try to stop me now
But you won't get the chance Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change
See it from a different view
Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change Rhythm floods my heart
The melody it feeds my soul
The tune tears me apart
And it swallows me whole
You should thank your lucky stars
'Cause the music is a gift
And it's stronger than all else
Provides me with uplift Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change
See it from a different view
Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change My lyrics revealing
Some natural vibe
Some kind of laid back feeling
Oh, just let it ride
And when Frank Sinatra sings
It's too much to take
So I sing the standard shit
It pacifies my ache Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change
See it from a different view
Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change Meet you downstairs in the bar and heard
Your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt
You say, "Why did you do it with him today?"
And sniff me out like I was Tanqueray 'Cause you're my fella, my guy
Hand me your Stella and fly
By the time I'm out the door
You tear me down like Roger Moore I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
You know that I'm no good Upstairs in bed with my ex-boy
He's in the place, but I can't get joy
Thinking of you in the final throes
This is when my buzzer goes Run out to meet your chips and pitter
You say when we're married 'cause you're not bitter
There'll be none of him no more
I cried for you on the kitchen floor I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
You know that I'm no good Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain
We're like how we were again
I'm in the tub, you're on the seat
Lick your lips as I soak my feet Then you notice little carpet burn
My stomach drops, and my guts churn
You shrug, and it's the worst
To truly stuck the knife in first I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
You know that I'm no good
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
Yeah, ya know that I'm no good Got back together with my man last night
But I think I was dreaming, he didn't feel quite right
I pressed his chest under my fingertips
Beside myself I sighed and reminded of his lips I'm confused and quizzical
Funny don'tcha know
I just wan get physical
Let me tell ya how Do me good, I'll tell you anything you want to hear
Do me good, do me good, do me good, do me good
Do me good and all this craziness will disappear
Do me good, do me good, do me good, do me good It's like he was designed with me in mind
He's so good from behind, he's beautifully defined
I miss him most of all when it got late
Attempt to hear him breathing or feel his shifting weight I'm confused and quizzical
Funny don'tcha know
I just wan get physical
Let me tell ya how Do me good, I'll tell you anything you want to hear
Do me good, do me good, do me good, do me good
Do me good and all this craziness will disappear
Do me good, do me good, do me good, do me good I never wanted you to be my man
I just wanted to see what you could do, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I feel it my heart like you were there
I never wanted you, many times when I tried to set you right, it's just too hard
I never wanted you to be my man but I really couldn't control myself I can't wait to get away from you
And surprisingly you hate me too
We only communicate when we need to fight
But we are best friends...right? You're too good at pretending you don't care
There's enough resentment in the air
Now you don't want me in the flat
When you're home at night
But we're best friends right? You're Stephanie and I'm Paulette
You know what all my faces mean
And it's easy to smoke it up, forget
Everything that happened in between Nicky's right when he says I can't win
So I don't wanna tell you anything
I can't even think about
How you feel inside
But we are best friends, right? I don't like the way you say my name
You're always looking for someone to blame
Now you want me to suffer just cause
You was born wide
But we are best friends right? You're Stephanie and I'm Paulette
You know what all my faces mean
And its easy to smoke it up, forget
Everything that happened in between So I had love for you when I was 4
And there's no one I wanna smoke with more
Someday I'll buy the Rizla, so you get the dro
Cause we are best friends right, right, right, right?
Because we are best friends right?
Because we are best friends right? My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul
I spend my days in longin'
And wondering why it's me you're (ogling) I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul
I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
And less I could have one more chance to prove, dear My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul
My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I would gladly surrender myself to you body and soul Attracts me, till it hurts to concentrate,
Distract me, stop me doin work I hate
Just to show him how it feels;
I walk past his desk in heels
One leg resting on the chair
From the side he pulls my hair. Amy Amy Amy
Although I've been here before
Amy Amy Amy
Your just to hard to ignore
Masculin you spin a spell
I think you'd wear me well
Amy Amy Amy
Wheres my morel parallel It takes me, half an hour to write a verse
He makes me imagine it from bad to worse
My weakness from the other sex
Every time his shoulders flex
The way the shirt hangs off his back
My train of thought spins right off track Amy Amy Amy
Although I've been here before Amy Amy Amy
He's just to hard to ignore
Masculine he spins a spell
I think he'd wear me well
Amy Amy Amy
Wheres my morel parallel His own style, right down to his diesel jeans
Imobile, I can't think by any means
Underwhere peeks at the top
I'll let you know where you should stop
From the picture my mind drew
I know I'd look good on you Amy Amy Amy
Although I've been here before
Amy Amy Amy
Your just to hard to ignore
Masculine you spin a spell
I think you'd wear me well
Amy Amy Amy
Wheres my morel parallel Creative energy abused
All my lyrics go unused
When I clock black hair blue eyes
I drift off I fantasize Amy Amy Amy

Amy Amy Amy
Wheres my morel parallel Nobody stands in between me and my man it's me and Mr Jones
What kind of fuckery is this? You made me Mr Slick Ricky
I thought I didn't love you when I did
I can't believe you played me out like that No you ain't worth guest lists plus one of all them girls you kissed
You can't keep lying to yourself like this
I can't believe you played yourself like this Who loves one thing but come Brixton
Nobody stands in between me and my man
'Cause it's me and Mr Jones
What kind of fuckery are we? Nowadays you don't mean dick to me
I might let you make it up to me, who's playing Saturday What kind of fuckery are you? Besides from some of you being my best black Joe
But I could swear that we were through
I still wonder about the things you do Mr Destiny lying infinitely, nobody stands in between me and my man
'Cause it's me and Mr Jones I can see you ahead of me
But I'm not always forward thinkin'
I tell you what you want to hear
It depends on what I've been drinkin' Cause everything I do or say
Makes it hard for you to stay
We both know what it is Now-a-days we talk too much
Like your forgetting all the good shit
You decide what's wrong with me
I always used to let you say But now I like to think out loud
Your runnin' with some different crowd
We both know what it is I don't know you anymore
Supposed to be the man
That I live my life by
And your attitude become a bore
And I'm so tired I cant even cry Mr Ultra sensitive
I'll never let myself forget you
Messed each other up you know
So I'm sorry if I upset you Tomorrow is another day
So I'll call you cause that's OK We both know what it is I don't know you anymore
Supposed to be the man
That I live my life by
And you're attitude become a bore
And I'm so tired
I can't even cry Relationship doesn't remain
We resonate on different flames
I could cut you down again
If you were like all other men
If you were like all other men
I know that I could shut you down again
But my friend, but my friend I don't know you anymore
Supposed to be the man
That I live my life by
And your attitude become a bore
And I'm so tired I cant even cry I don't know you anymore
Supposed to be the man
That I live my life by
And your attitude become a bore
And I'm so tired I can't even cry All I can ever be to you,
Is a darkness that we knew,
And this regret I had to get accustomed to,
Once it was so right,
When we were at our high,
Waiting for you in the hotel at night,
I knew I hadn't met my match,
But every moment we could snatch,
I don't know why I got so attached,
It's my responsibility,
And you don't owe nothing to me,
But to walk away I have no capacity He walks away,
The sun goes down,
He takes the day but I'm grown,
And in this grey, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own, I don't understand,
Why do I stress a man,
When there's so many better things at hand,
We could a never had it all,
We had to hit a wall,
So this is inevitable withdrawal,
Even if I stop wanting you,
A perspective pushes through,
I'll be some next man's other woman soon, I shouldn't play myself again,
I should just be my own best friend,
Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men, He walks away,
The sun goes down,
He takes the day but I'm grown,
And it's okay,
In this blue shade,
My tears dry on their own, So we are history,
Your shadow covers me
The sky above,
A blaze He walks away,
The sun goes down,
He takes the day but I'm grown,
And it's okay,
In this blue shade
My tears dry on their own, I wish I could say no regrets,
And no emotional debts,
And as we kiss goodbye the sun sets,
So we are history,
The shadow covers me,
The sky above a blaze that only lovers see, He walks away,
The sun goes down,
He takes the day but I'm grown,
And it's okay,
In this blue shade,
My tears dry on their own, He walks away,
The sun goes down,
He takes the day but I'm grown,
And it's okay,
My deep shade,
My tears dry on their own He walks away,
The sun goes down,
He takes the day but I'm grown,
And it's okay,
My deep shade,
My tears dry She sits home and dreams
That her man will leave his mark on her hand
He's not all he seems
But she's seen a dress, she has the flowers planned
Now she won't be happy
Till she look down and sees the engagement ring
It's for security
But she will be waiting years for her wedding [Chorus]
For me it ain't real
It's fools gold
There too many fools sold
Not an excuse oh
For me it ain't real
It's fools gold
I don't hear everything I'm told He won't change her life
He just chasing tail
And wasting her time
She calls herself his wife
He calls her at 8 says be here by 9
She don't notice how when she gets the ring
It's not a good fit
So next time that they row She throws it out
It goes to the last girl he hit [Chorus] So take the gold you find
And for your own sake
Hold it in your hand
Now make sure you bite down
And watch your tooth don't break on that wedding band For me it ain't real
It's fools gold
There too many fools sold
Not an excuse oh
For me it ain't real
Yes it's fools gold Every day I see you
My hands were made for you
And you always give me stress free point of view
Pick you up after school Mister Magic, take a token
Mister Magic, of my love
Mister Magic, I see you through the smoke Without you I'm misery
Blue without my green
All the songs sound better when you're next to me
Yeah, 'cause you come naturally Mister Magic, take a token
Mister Magic, of my love, love, love (Mister Magic)
I see you through the smoke Laying on my bed
I reach over for you
And you so fresh you even make the standards new
Burn the tip to get you through Mister Magic, take a token
Mister Magic, of my love
Mister Magic, I see you through the smoke Mister Magic
Mister Magic
Mister Magic, waiting for the smoke to clear
I'm waiting for the smoke to clear It's always gone within two days.
Follow my father, his extravagant ways.
So if I got it I will spend it all,
Camden and Parkway 'til I hit a wall. I cross my fingers at the cash machine,
As I check my balance I kiss the screen.
I love it when it says I got the means,
To go to Miss Sixty and pick up my new jeans. Chorus: (x2)
Never lasts me long,
Handle finance wrong,
Blow it all on bags and shoes,
Jazz 'n blues. Standin' too deep at the bar today,
Wait with impatience to throw my cash away.
Four white Russians a JD and Coke, Buy their drinks all night and now I am broke.
But that's cool 'cause I can borrow more from you,
And I didn't forget about that fifty pound, too.
Tell you what, my advance is comin' through,
I'll take you out shoppin',
Can you wait 'til next June? Yeah. Chorus:
Never lasts me long,
Handle finance wrong (handle it wrong),
Blow it all on bags and shoes,
Jazz 'n blues (jazz and blues).
Never lasts me long (long),
Handle finance wrong (wrong),
Blow it all on bags and shoes (blow it all),
Jazz 'n blues. Tall and tanned and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes
Each man she passes
Goes Aaah! When she moves it's like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gently
That when she passes
Each man she passes
Goes Aaah! Oh but he watches so sadly
How can he tell her he loves her
He would just give his heart gladly But each day when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead not at he Tall and tanned and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes
He smiles
But she doesn't see
No she doesn't see
She just doesn't see Runnin' down my batt - er- ies
Layin' me out to rest
Knowin' when that is
Five hours
I wake up and de-stress
And I'm diggin' myself into a hole
And these days I just work
I will when I have so much sun CHORUS:
And lately I've forgotten who I am
Late - ely my energy's just drained away
And now..my mind..is workin' overtime
It's been a loooong day
Such a long day, ...ay, ay mmm
and while all my contempt
For every...(all my friends say)
I should take in college now
My education is dragging, dragging
innit
My guitar to London town
And the thing that wakes me
when I could sleep instead
Is the thought that to deny?
That I could fall back into bed Chorus:
And lately, I 've forgotten who I am
Late - ely, my energy's just drained away
And now...my mind....is workin' overtime
It's been a looooooooooooooong day
It's been a long day Recently my head
It ain't recharged as such
And sleep can only cure, yeah
A restless mind so much Chorus:
Lately I've forgotten who I am
Sleep too late
My energy's just drained away
And now my mind is workin' overtime
It's been a long day
It's been a long long long day
It's been a long long long day
It's been a long day
So long, so long, so loooooooooong Mmm yeah
Oooooh, yeah [Chorus x2:]
B boy, be my baby (won't you be my baby)
My one and only baby (be my baby now)
B boy, be my baby (be my baby now)
My one and only baby (Oh, oh, oh, oh) It was winnin' time, you know what they say
Did you think about us, did you miss your baby?
I'ma catch the train, guess I'm headin' your way
You're my number one, that's all, a newborn son
Won't you be my king? (won't you be my king?) 'Cause I know you care, I'll dirty dance for you
And when I'm done I'm gonna do it again
And when it's over I'ma pull you closer
Keep your Nikes on, you know how we do
There's nothing he won't try
We're like two stars in the sky You are my rainy day, sunshine
It's plain to see
My heat in the cold of Winter
Just so right for me
So won't you please [Chorus] Put two in the air if you feel like me
Someone who cares feels so freaky
In demand by all the ladies
He's not for sale, he's being home-delivered to me
So hang up for your trying cards, please (he's my baby) Love-sick calls, that's what I get
I hear his voice and things get wet
Knows what I want, then he'll fetch
He's my boo and I'm his little pet, his little pet
You never know what he'll do next, he's my baby My rainy days, my sunshine
Living fantasy
My heat in the cold of Winter
Just so right for me
So won't you please [Chorus x2] Make a name for myself in different ways
All the while you will see my songs of praise
How can I concentrate when all the while my head
Throw me scenarios so I tease my self esteem
Though I can talk it through
Really I finally talk
My frustration is released but nothing let em know
And added to that Im sick of having to seek some peace
Because I need emotion with my physical release Cant help
But bring it up and beat the point to death
But my
Words are for nothing, Im wasting my breath
Cant help
But bring it up and beat the point to death
But my words are for nothing, I just keep wasting my breath Now everywhere I got and I always stare
I justify attraction by your hands, your lips, your hair
And so although I always look I know that I cant touch
And because I can only take a full time man so much
And now I reached a point where I dont care anymore
Its a necessity just like it was before
Many says I ignore the way my body aches
Cause Im the shit I earn I cant look for my sins
Oh, oh, no Cant help
But bring it up and beat the point to death
But my
Words are for nothing, Im wasting my breath
Cant help
But bring it up and beat the point to death
But my words are for nothing, I just keep wasting my breath Cant help
I cant help but bring it up, no
But my
Nothing, no
Cant
I cant help, no, no
But my words are for nothing, I just keep wasting my breath Cant help
But bring it up and beat the point to death
But my
Words are for nothing, Im wasting my breath
Cant help
But bring it up and beat the point to death
But my words are for nothing, I just keep wasting my breath Cant help
But my
Cant help
But my words are for nothing, I just keep wasting my breath You're just a little boy underneath that hat
You need your nerve to hide your ego, don't come with that
You think everything is handed to you free
But it's not that easy, no I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta know you now and then My girl says I'm too sensitive to ride with you
But I'm not listening to her, mm hm
Yes I'm perceptive so when I've dance with you
You'll whisk your head back the way it were
As you were I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta know you now and then Oh, I'm not ruling you out
I'm just in doubt as to what you say you're all about, yeah I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta show you now and them
I gotta know you now and then I gotta know you now
We may never meet again I gotta know you now
We may never meet again I gotta know you now
We may never meet again I gotta know you now
We may never meet again You should be stronger than me
You been here 7 years longer than me
Don't you know you supposed to be the man,
Not pal in comparison to who you think I am, You always wanna talk it through - I don't care!
I always have to comfort you when I'm there
But that's what I need you to do - stroke my hair! 'cause' I've forgotten all of young love's joy,
Feel like a lady, but you my lady boy, You should be stronger than me,
But instead you're longer than frozen turkey,
Why'd you always put me in control?
All I need is for my man to live up to his role,
Always wanna talk it through- I'm ok,
Always have to comfort you every day,
But that's what I need you to do - are you gay? I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, but you my lady boy He said 'the respect I made you earn -
Thought you had so many lessons to learn'
I said 'You don't know what love is - get a grip!' -
Sounds as if you're reading from some other tired script I'm not gonna meet your mother anytime
I just wanna rip your body over mine
So tell me why you think that's a crime I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, but you my lady boy Today my bird flew away
Gone to find her big blue jay
Starlight before she took flight
I sung a lullaby of bird land every night
Sung for my Ava every night Ava was the morning, now she's gone
She's reborn like Sarah Vaughan
In the sanctuary she has found
Birds surround her sweet sound
And Ava flies in paradise With dread I woke in my bed
To shooting pains up in my head
Lovebird, my beautiful bird
Spoken 'til one day she couldn't be heard
She just stopped singing Ava was the morning, now she's gone
She's reborn like Sarah Vaughan
In the sanctuary she has found
Birds surround her sweet sound
And Ava flies in paradise It begins to tell 'round midnight
'Round midnight
I do pretty well 'til after sundown
Suppertime I'm feeling sad
But it really gets bad 'round midnight Memories always start 'round midnight
'Round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And old midnight knows it too When some quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending
Darling I need you
Lately I find
You're out of my arms
And I'm out of my mind Let our love take wing some midnight
'Round midnight
Let the angels sing
For your returning
Let our love be safe and sound
When old midnight comes around Let our love take wing some midnight
'Round midnight
Let the angels sing
For your returning
Let our love be safe and sound
When old midnight comes around He can only hold her for so long, the lights are on but no one's home
She's so vacant, her soul is taken
He thinks 'What's she running from?
Now, how can he have a heart? When it got stole
So he tries to pacify her, for what's inside her never dies Even if she's contenting his wants, she is played with urgency
Searches the man she misses, the man that he longs to be
Now, how can he have her heart? When it got stole
So he tries to pacify her, 'cause what's inside her never dies So he tries to pacify her, 'cause of what's inside her it never dies
So he tries to pacify her, for what's inside her never dies Meet you downstairs in the bar and heard
Your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt
You say, "What did you do with him today?"
And sniff me out like I was Tanqueray 'Cause you're my fella, my guy
Hand me your Stella and fly
By the time I'm out the door
You tear me down like Roger Moore I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
You know that I'm no good Upstairs in bed with my ex-boy
He's in the place, but I can't get joy
Thinking of you in the final throes
This is when my buzzer goes Run out to meet your chips and pitter
You say when we're married 'cause you're not bitter
There'll be none of him no more
I cried for you on the kitchen floor I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
You know that I'm no good Ayo, I knew you was trouble when I first laid eyes on you
Temperature's so hot, the heat just rise with you
Let me ride with you, talk about your mistakes
You cheated yourself but these are the breaks
And it never be the same again, cause of old boy
But oh boy, together we make so much joy
In the sands and oh, what a wet, wee-wee
But you played me, so I had to roll up my sleeves and
Hunt you down, holding the next man's stacks
Now you sorry, tryin' bring that old thing back and
Act like we can rekindle that flame
It's a shame, how you can't get me off the brain
He that lame, you love how I bring the pain
Got the rug burns stinging and you saying my name
Say my name, that's right, I'm high post
Get the champagne, love, word up, we gon' toast I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
Yet you know that I'm no good Attracts me, till it hurts to concentrate,
Distract me, stop me doin work I hate
Just to show him how it feels;
I walk past his desk in heels
One leg resting on the chair
From the side he pulls my hair. Amy Amy Amy

Unsurprisingly you hate me too
We only communicate when we need to fight
But we are best friends right? You're too good at pretending you don't care
There's enough resentment in the air
Now you don't want me in the flat
When you?re home at night
But we're best friends right? You're Stephanie and I'm Paulette
You know what all my faces mean
And it's easy to smoke it up, forget
Everything that happened in between Nicky's right when he says I can't win
So I don't wanna tell you anything
I can't even think about
How you feel inside
But we are best friends, right? I don't like the way you say my name
You're always looking for someone to blame
Now you want me to suffer just cause
You was born wide
But we are best friends right? You're Stephanie and I'm Paulette
You know what all my faces mean
And its easy to smoke it up, forget
Everything that happened in between So I had love for you when I was 4
And there's no one I wanna smoke with more
Someday I'll buy the Rizla, so you get the dro
'Cause we are best friends right, right, right, right?
Because we are best friends right?
Because we are best friends right? It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to
Cry if I want to
You would cry too if it's happened to you
Nobody knows where my johnny has gone
But Judy left the same time
Why was he holding her hand
When he's supposed to be mine Play all my records keep dancing all night
But leave me alone for a while
'Till johnny's dancing with me
I've got no reason to smile Judy and johnny just walked through that door
Like a queen with her king
Oh what a birthday surprise
Judy's wearing his ring Lent you outsiders and my new Badu
While you were thinking I didn't have a clue
Tough to sort files with your voice in my head
So then I bribed you downstairs with a Marlboro red And now I feel so small discovering you knew
How much more torture would you have put me through?
You probably saw me laughing at all your jokes
Or how I did not mind when you stole all my smokes yeah And although my pride is not easy to disturb yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
With your battered jeans and your Beastie tee
Now I can't work like this, with you next to me And although he's nothing in the scheme of my years
It just serves to bludgeon my futile tears
And I'm not use to this,no no, I observe, I don't chase
So now I'm stuck with consequences, thrust in my face
And the melodramas of my day delivery blows
And that surpass your rejection it just goes to show
A simple attraction that reflects right back to me
So I'm not as into you as I appear to be And although my pride's not easily disturbed
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
With your battered jeans and your Beastie tee yeah yeah
Now I can't work like this with you next to me yeah yeah His message was brutal but the delivery was kind
Maybe if I get this down I'll get it off my mind
It serves to condition me and smoothen my kinks
Despite my frustration for the way that he thinks
And I knew the truth, when it came, would be to that effect
At least you're attracted to me which I did not expect
Didn't think you get my number down as such
But I never hated myself for my age so much yeah And although my pride's, yeah, not easily disturbed, yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
So with your battered jeans yeah and your Beastie tee
Now I can't work like this, no, with you next to me And although my pride's, yeah, not easily disturbed, yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
So with your battered jeans yeah and your Beastie tee
Now I can't work like this, no, with you next to me Ooh....... New York x2 Grew up in a town that is famous as a place of movie scenes
Noise is always loud, there are sirens all around and the streets are mean
If I can make it here, I can make it anywhere, that's what they say
Seeing my face in lights or my name on marquees found down on Broadway Even if it ain't all it seems, I got a pocket full of dreams
Baby, I'm from New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it from New York, New York, New York! On the avenue, there ain't never a curfew, ladies work so hard
Such a melting pot, on the corner selling rock, preachers pray to God
Hail a gypsy-cab, takes me down from Harlem to the Brooklyn Bridge
Some will sleep tonight with a hunger far more than an empty fridge I'm gonna make it by any means, I got a pocket full of dreams
Baby, I'm from New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it from New York, New York, New York! One hand in the air for the big city,
Street lights, big dreams all looking pretty
No place in the world that can compare
Put your lighters in the air, everybody say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah In New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it from New York! She's just a girl, and she's on fire
Hotter than a fantasy, longer like a highway
She's living in a world, and it's on fire
Feeling the catastrophe, but she knows she can fly away
Oh, she got both feet on the ground
And she's burning it down
Oh, she got her head in the clouds
And she's not backing down This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire Looks like a girl, but she's a flame
So bright, she can burn your eyes
Better look the other way
You can try but you'll never forget her name
She's on top of the world
Hottest of the hottest girls say
Oh, we got our feet on the ground
And we're burning it down
Oh, got our head in the clouds
And we're not coming down This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire Everybody stands, as she goes by
Cause they can see the flame that's in her eyes
Watch her when she's lighting up the night
Nobody knows that she's a lonely girl
And it's a lonely world
But she gon' let it burn, baby, burn, baby This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire
Oh, oh, oh,
She's just a girl, and she's on fire I just want you close
Where you can stay forever
You can be sure
That it will only get better You and me together
Through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause
Everything's going to be alright
People keep talking they can say what they like
But all I know is everything's going to be alright No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you, you, you
Can get in the way of what I feel for you When the rain is pouring down
And my heart is hurting
You will always be around
This I know for certain
You and me together
Through the days and nights I don't worry 'cause
Everything's going to be alright
People keep talking they can say what they like

To find something like what we have
I know people will try try to divide something so real
So til the end of time I'm telling you there is no one No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you, you, you Oh oh oh oh

Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power, yeah
Some people live just to play the game Some people think that the physical things define what's within
And I've been there before, and that life's a bore
So full of the superficial Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, yeah Some people search for a fountain
That promises forever young
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way to prove you love them Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be
With no one to share, with no one who truly cares for me Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings

So nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing
If I ain't got you with me baby Ooh....... New York x2 Grew up in a town that is famous as a place of movie scenes
Noise is always loud, there are sirens all around and the streets are mean
If I can make it here, I can make it anywhere, that's what they say
Seeing my face in lights or my name on marquees found down on Broadway Even if it ain't all it seems, I got a pocket full of dreams
Baby, I'm from New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it from New York, New York, New York! On the avenue, there ain't never a curfew, ladies work so hard
Such a melting pot, on the corner selling rock, preachers pray to God
Hail a gypsy-cab, takes me down from Harlem to the Brooklyn Bridge
Some will sleep tonight with a hunger far more than an empty fridge I'm gonna make it by any means, I got a pocket full of dreams
Baby, I'm from New York

Hear it from New York! She's just a girl, and she's on fire
Hotter than a fantasy, longer like a highway
She's living in a world, and it's on fire
Feeling the catastrophe, but she knows she can fly away
Oh, she got both feet on the ground
And she's burning it down
Oh, she got her head in the clouds
And she's not backing down This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire Looks like a girl, but she's a flame
So bright, she can burn your eyes
Better look the other way
You can try but you'll never forget her name
She's on top of the world
Hottest of the hottest girls say
Oh, we got our feet on the ground
And we're burning it down
Oh, got our head in the clouds
And we're not coming down This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire Everybody stands, as she goes by
Cause they can see the flame that's in her eyes
Watch her when she's lighting up the night
Nobody knows that she's a lonely girl
And it's a lonely world
But she gon' let it burn, baby, burn, baby This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire

That is famous as a place of movie scenes
Noise is always loud
There are sirens all around
And the streets are mean
If I could make it here
I could make it anywhere
That's what they say
Seeing my face in lights
Or my name in marquees found down Broadway Even if it ain't all it seems

Street lights, big dreams, all looking pretty
No place in the world that can compared
Put your lighters in the air
Everybody say yeah, yeah yeah [Chorus] Moment of honesty
Someones gotta take the lead tonight
Who's it gonna be?
I'm gonna sit right here
And tell you all that comes to me
If you have something to say
You should say it right now You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it
Its becoming something that's impossible to ignore
And I can't take it
I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable would it make us look crazy
If you ask me I'm ready
If you ask me I'm ready I know you said to me
"This is exactly how it should feel when its meant to be"
Time is only wasting so why wait for eventually
If we gonna do something 'bout it
We should do it right now
(We should do it right now) You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I know I deserve it
Its becoming something that's impossible to ignore
It is what we make it
I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable would it make us look crazy
Or would it be so beautiful either way I'm sayin'
If you ask me I'm ready
If you ask me I'm ready Why give up before we try
Feel the lows before the highs
Clip our wings before we fly away (fly away)
I can't say I came prepared
I'm suspended in the air
Won't you come be in the sky with me I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable would it make us look crazy
Or would it be so beautiful either way I'm sayin'
If you ask me I'm ready
If you ask me I'm ready
If you ask me I'm ready
If you ask me I'm ready I keep on fallin'
In and out of love
With you
Sometimes I love ya
Sometimes you make me blue
Sometimes I feel good
At times I feel used
Lovin' you darlin'
Makes me so confused I keep on fallin'
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I love you Oh, oh, I never felt this way
How do you give me so much pleasure
And cause me so much pain
Just when I think
I've taken more than would a fool
I start fallin' back in love with you I keep on fallin'
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I love you Oh, baby
I, I, I, I'm fallin'
I, I, I, I'm fallin'
Fall I keep on fallin'
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I love you I'm fallin'
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I love you I'm fallin'
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I love you What? Even if you were a million miles away
I can still feel you in my bed
Near me, touch me, feel me And even at the bottom of the sea
I could still hear inside my head
Telling me, touch me, feel me
And all the time, you were telling me lies So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you Have you ever try sleeping with a broken heart?
Well you could try sleeping in my bed
Lonely, own me, nobody ever shut it down like you You wore the crown, you made my body feel heaven bound
Why don't you hold me, need me
I thought you told me, you'd never leave me Looking in the sky I could see your face
Then I knew right where I fit in
Take me, make me, you know that I'll always be in love with you
Right till the end So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you Anybody could've told you right from the start it's 'bout to fall apart
So rather than hold on to a broken dream I'll just hold on to love
And I could find a way to make it, don't hold on too tight
I'll make it without you tonight So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you Some people live for the fortune

Nothing seems complete
I stand up and I'm searching
For the better part of me
I hang my head from sorrow
State of humanity
I wear it on my shoulders
Gotta find the strength in me I am a Superwoman
Yes I am
Yes she is
Even when I'm a mess
I still put on a vest
With an S on my chest
Oh yes
I'm a Superwoman For all the mothers fighting
For better days to come
And all my women, all my women sitting here trying
To come home before the sun
And all my sisters
Coming together
Say yes I will
Yes I can I am a Superwoman
Yes I am
Yes she is
Even when I'm a mess
I still put on a vest
With an S on my chest
Oh yes
I'm a Superwoman When I'm breaking down
And I can't be found
And I start to get weak
Cause no one knows
Me underneath these clothes
But I can fly
We can fly, ooh I am a Superwoman
Yes I am
Yes she is
Even when I'm a mess
I still put on a vest
With an S on my chest
Oh yes

Big dreams in my head empty my tummy
Might crack a smile but ain't nothin' funny I remember playin' over needles in the streets
Everywhere I go a man want some part of me
Dirty Dirty hookas and hoes on 11th avenue

Yesterday Mikey call me pan mi phone
Me say Mikey It's been a while, I'm not who I was before
You look surprised, your words don't burn me anymore
Been meaning to tell you, but I guess it's clear to see
Don't be mad, it's just the brand new kind of me
Can't be bad, I found a brand new kind of free Careful with your ego, he's the one that we should blame
Had to grab my heart back
God know something had to change
I thought that you'd be happy
I found the one thing I need, why you mad
It's just the brand new kind of me It took a long long time to get here
It took a brave, brave girl to try
It took one too many excuses, one too many lies
Don't be surprised, don't be surprised if i talk a little louder
If I speak up when you're wrong
If I walk a little taller
I'd be known to you too long
If you noticed that I'm different
Don't take it personally
Don't be mad, it's just the brand new kind of me
And it ain't bad, I found a brand new kind of free Oh, it took a long long road to get here
It took a brave brave girl to try
I've taken one too many excuses, one too many lies
Don't be surprised, oh see you look surprised Hey, if you were a friend, you want to get know me again
If you were worth a while
You'd be happy to see me smile
I'm not expecting sorry
I'm too busy finding myself
I got this
I found me, I found me, yeah I don't need your opinion
I'm not waiting for your okay
I'll never be perfect, but at least now I'm brave
Now, my heart is open
And I can finally breathe
Don't be mad, it's just the brand new kind of free
That ain't bad, I found a brand new kind of me
Don't be mad, it's just a brand new time for me We're at the crossroads, my dear
Where do we go from here?
Maybe you won't go, maybe you'll stay
Oh I know I'm gonna miss you either ways
It's such a lonely road [Chorus: x2]
Where do we go from here?
All I can do is, follow the tracks of my tears
Oh
When I cry your name
Am I crawling in bed
Oh and am I waiting only to drown in pain
Oh
Don't you do it
No, said don't you leave me this way
I don't know
If I can lift my head and face another day
Ooh it's such a lonely road Where do we go from here?
All I can do is, follow the tracks of my tears
You seem now the kind of girl who's lost and looking for direction
(Who could this be? Staring at me)
When I'm looking in the mirror trying to find a resolution
(Me too far gone, to find my way home) [Chorus] Where do we go from here?
All I can do is, follow the tracks of my tears If I had no more time
No more time left to be here
Would you cherish what we had'
Was it everything that you were looking for?
If I couldn't feel your touch
And no longer were you with me
I'd be wishing you were here
To be everything that I'd be looking for
I don't wanna forget the present is a gift
And I don't wanna take for granted the time you may have here with me
'Cause lord only knows another day is not really guaranteed So every time you hold me
Hold me like this is the last time
Every time you kiss me
Kiss me like you'll never see me again
Every time you touch me
Touch me like this is the last time
Promise that you'll love me
Love me like you'll never see me again Oh oh oh How many really know what love is'
Millions never will
Do you know until you lose it That it's everything that we are looking for
When I wake up in the morning
You're beside me
I'm so thankful that I found
Everything that I been looking for I don't wanna forget the present is a gift
And I don't wanna take for granted the time you may have here with me
'Cause lord only knows another day is not really guaranteed So every time you hold me
Hold me like this is the last time
Every time you kiss me
Kiss me like you'll never see me again
(Can you do that for me baby)
Every time you touch me
(See we don't really know)
Touch me like this is the last time
(See everyday we never know)
Promise that you'll love me
(I want you to promise me)
Love me like you'll never see me again
(Like you'll never see me again) Oh oh oh oh oh This song is dedicated
To all the lovers who cant be together
Separated by distance and time You were always on my mind
All I do is count the days
Where are you now? Know I never let you down
I will never go away I really wish that you would stay but what would we do
All the days that you've been gone I dream about you
And I anticipate the day that you will come home, home, home No matter how far you are
No matter how long it takes him
Through distance and time
I'll be waiting And if you have to walk a million miles
I'll wait a million days to see you smile
Distance and time, I'll be waiting Distance and time, I'll be waiting
Will you take a train, to meet me where I am
Are you on your way?
And I will never do anything to hurt you
I'll never live without you I really wish that you would stay but what would we do
All the days that you've been gone I dreamed about you
And I anticipate the day that you will come home, home, home No matter how far you are
No matter how long it takes him
Distance and time, I'll be waiting
And if you have to walk a million miles

Oh oh oh oh She's just a girl, and she's on fire
Hotter than a fantasy, longer like a highway
She's living in a world, and it's on fire
Feeling the catastrophe, but she knows she can fly away
Oh, she got both feet on the ground
And she's burning it down
Oh, she got her head in the clouds
And she's not backing down This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire Looks like a girl, but she's a flame
So bright, she can burn your eyes
Better look the other way
You can try but you'll never forget her name
She's on top of the world
Hottest of the hottest girls say
Oh, we got our feet on the ground
And we're burning it down
Oh, got our head in the clouds
And we're not coming down This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire Everybody stands, as she goes by
Cause they can see the flame that's in her eyes
Watch her when she's lighting up the night
Nobody knows that she's a lonely girl
And it's a lonely world
But she gon' let it burn, baby, burn, baby This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire
Oh, oh, oh,
She's just a girl, and she's on fire Used to dream of being a millionaire, without a care
But if I'm seeing my dreams and you aren't there
'Cause it's over
That just wont be fair
Darling
Rather be a poor woman living on the street
No food to eat
'Cause I don't want no pie if I have to cry
'Cause it's over
When you said goodbye! All at once
I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything
Now that you're gone
From afar, seems I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything
Since you're gone Now I see myself through different eyes
It's no surprise!
Being alone will make you realize
When it's over!
All in love is fair I shoulda been there
I shoulda been there, I shoulda shoulda All at once
I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything
Now that you're gone
From afar, seems I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything
Since you're gone I know I pushed you away
What can I do that would save our love
Take these material things
They don't mean nothing
It's you that I want All at once
I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything
Now that you're gone
From afar
Seems I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything
Since you're gone I shoulda been there
I shoulda been there, I shoulda, I shoulda All at once
I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything
Now that you're gone
From afar
Seems I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything
Since you're gone Get so caught up everyday
Tryna keep it all together
While the time it slips away
You see I know nothing last forever Imagine there was no tomorrow
Imagine that I couldn't see your face
There would be no limit to my sorrow
So all I can say I wanna tell you something, give you something
Show you in so many ways
'Cause it would all mean nothing if I don't say something before it all goes away
Don't wanna wait to bring you flowers, waste another hour let alone another day
I'm gonna tell you something, show you something, won't wait till it's too late (I can't wait, I can't wait, I won't wait, I don't wanna wait)
(I can't wait, I can't wait, I won't wait, I don't wanna wait) Just a simple conversation
Just a moment is all it takes
I wanna be there just to listen
(I wanna be here)
And I don't wanna hesitate Imagine there was no tomorrow
Imagine that I couldn't see your face
There would be no limit to my sorrow
'Cause there's nothing that could fill that space
I don't wanna put it off for too long
I didn't say all that I had to say
I wanna take my time and right the wrong before we get to that place I wanna tell you something, give you something
Show you in so many ways
'Cause it would all mean nothing if I don't say something before it all goes away
Don't wanna wait to bring you flowers, waste another hour let alone another day

I can't wait, I can't wait, I won't wait, I don't wanna wait Oooh oooh, New York (x2) Grew up in a town,
That is famous as a place of movie scenes
Noise is always loud
There are sirens all around
And the streets are mean
If I could make it here
I could make it anywhere
That's what they say
Seeing my face in lights
Or my name in marquees found down Broadway Even if it ain't all it seems
I got a pocketful of dreams
Baby, I'm from [Chorus]
New York, concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York, New York, New York On the avenue, there ain't never a curfew
Ladies work so hard
Such a melting pot on the corner selling rock
Preachers pray to God
Hail a gypsy cab
Takes me down from Harlem to the Brooklyn Bridge
Someone sleeps tonight with a hunger
For more than from an empty fridge I'm going to make it by any means
I got a pocketful of dreams
Baby, I'm from [Chorus: x2] One hand in the air for the big city
Street lights, big dreams, all looking pretty
No place in the world that can compared
Put your lighters in the air
Everybody say yeah, yeah yeah [Chorus] Said I'd be gone by five
But it's sun rise and I'm still in your bed
Goodnight usually means goodbye

Golden tone voice

Another bill
From a killer
Turned a thrill
Into a tragedy Yeah, a door left open
A woman walking by
A drop in the water
A look in the eye
A phone on the table
A man on your side
Someone that you think
That you can trust is just
Another way to die Another tricky little gun
Giving solace to the one
That will never see
The sunshine
Another inch of your life
Sacrificed
For your brother
In the nick of time
Another dirty money
Heaven sent honey
Turning on a dime Well, a door left open

Baby Baby Weren't you the one that said
That you don't want me anymore
And how you need your space
And give the keys back to your door
And how I cried and tried
And tried to make you stay with me
But still you said the love was gone
And that I had to leave (Now you) talkin' bout a family
(Now you) sayin' I complete your dream
(Now you) sayin' I'm your everything
You're confusing me, what you say to me
Don't play with me, don't play with me, 'cause (What goes around, comes around
What goes up, must come down)
Now who's cryin', desirin' to come back to me
(What goes around, comes around
What goes up, must come down)
Now who's cryin', desirin' to come back I remember when I was sittin' home alone
Waiting for you 'til three o'clock in the morn' And when you came home
You'd always have some sorry excuse
Half explaining to me
Like I'm just some kind of a fool
I sacrificed the things I want
Just to do things for you
But when it's time to do for me
You never come through (Now you) wanna be up under me
(Now you) have so much to say to me, hey
(Now you) want to make time for me

Waiting for you 'til three o'clock in the morn'
Night after night, knowing somethin' goin' on
Wasn't long before I be g-g-gone
Lord knows it wasn't easy, believe me
Never thought you'd be the one that would deceive me
And never do what you supposed to do
No need to approach me boo, 'cause I'm over you (What goes around, comes around
What goes up, must come down)
Now who's cryin', desirin' to come back to me

What goes up, must come down)
Now who's cryin', desirin' to come back to me Can't wait till I get home

That I would want someone to hold me
Show me like you, falling in a daze
So many ways, I'm in amazement Thinking about you, no one took the time
To hold my mind, and be the kind
That I could talk to, this is the type of day
That I must say, I've been looking forward to Look at me shedding no tears
No worries followed by fear
So good that soon you'll be here
They just don't know how good it feels Feels so good to not be searching
Searching just to find that someone
Feels so good to not be searching
Knowing that I found that right one I'm waiting for your love
Waiting for your love
I'm waiting for your love
Waiting for your love Talking on the phone
When I'm alone, I'm in the zone
And tempted to touch you
Nothing ever fades The way you take time for me
It makes me want you, call it what you want
It may be wrong but baby I'm your fool
I can verify that you're my type
The things we try that others just won't do Look at me shedding no tears
No worries followed by fear

Waiting for your love Some people they call me crazy
For falling in love with you
They can take me and lock me away baby
'Cause there is nothing those bars can do I will be the rising moon after setting sun
Just to let you know that you'll always have someone
I will be the clearest day when the rain is done
So you will always know Through a shake of an earthquake
I will never fall
That's how strong my love is
Like a ship through the storm
We can risk it all
That's how strong my love is I use to feel kinda lonely
'Cause the world it can be so fake
And all that matters I'm telling you
Is you and me only
And the fortunes of love we make I will be the water you need in the desert land
Just to let you know you will always have my hand
I will be the woman you need to be a better man
So you will always know Through a shake of an earthquake
I will never fall
That's how strong my love is
Like a ship through the storm
We can risk it all
That's how strong my love is Oh, can nothing break us down
Oh, cause we are heaven bound
Like the mountain standing tall
And moving over here to stay
Oh, can nothing get in the way Through a shake of an earthquake
I will never fall (I will never fall)
That's how strong my love is
(that's how strong my love my love is)
Like a ship through the storm
We can risk it all (we can risk it all)

And it was raining
Just to rub it in

Can't let it get me down It's alright It's alright It's alright It's alright It's alright It's alright It's alright Yes I was burned but I called it a lesson learned
Mistake overturned
So I call it a lesson learned
My soul has returned
So I call it a lesson learned
Another lesson learned Sometimes
Some lies
Can take a minute
To fully realize
His tears
Your eyes
Thirty seconds to apologize
You give it one more chance
Just like the time before
But he already know you'd give a hundred more
Until that night in bed
You wake up in a sweat
You're racing to the door
Can't take it anymore I was burned but I called it a lesson learned
Mistake overturned
So I call it a lesson learned
My soul has returned
So I call it a lesson learned
Another lesson learned Life perfect
Ain't perfect
If you don't know what the struggle's for
Falling down ain't falling down
If you don't cry when you hit the floor
It's called the past cause I'm getting past
And I ain't nothing like I was before
You ought to see me now Yes I was burned but I called it a lesson learned
Mistake overturned
So I call it a lesson learned
My soul has returned

And I still remember everything you said (umm)
I always thought our love was so right
I guess I was wrong (oh)
Always thought you'll be by my side
Pappa, now you're gone
What I wanna know baby, if what we had was good
How come you don't call me, anymore Still like a fire on a rainy night
I still like it better when you holding me tight
Everybody said, everybody said, that we should never part, no no
Telling me baby baby baby why
Why you wanna go and break my heart
All I wanna know is baby, if what we had was good
How come you don't call me anymore Sometimes it feels like I'm gonna die
If you don't call me, pappa
Oh, you got to try
I'll get down on me knees hoping you please
Please (oh oh)
Won't you call me sometime, pappa Why don't you call me
Why on earth can't you just pick up the phone
You know I don't like to be alone
How come you don't call me (why must you torture me)
How come you don't call me
How come you don't call me There's a hole in my heart I've been hiding
I've been strong for so long that I'm blind
Is there a place I can go where the lonely river flows?
Where fear ends and faith begins Hallelujah, hallelujah, let me in
I've been praying but I'm paying for my sins
Won't you give me a sign before I lose my mind?
Woah, hallelujah, let me in Every step makes me think that I'm closer
But somehow I just never arrived
When our hope disappears, please protect me from my tears
I need you right by my side Hallelujah, hallelujah, let me in
I've been praying but I'm paying for my sins
Won't you give me a sign before I lose my mind?
Woah, hallelujah, let me in Woah, woah, hallelujah
Woah, woah, hallelujah
All the places I've been
Please forgive me for my sins
Woah, hallelujah, let me in Woah, woah, let me in
Woah, woah, let me in
Woah, woah
Please forgive me for my sins
Woah, hallelujah, let me in Ooh, yeah

That you know you got me under wraps, locks and keys and
And that without you I just, I'm gonna be lost
But I got somethin' else for you Baby, I used to sit home waitin' for your call

And I don't care if you don't call no more We used to light a fire on a rainy night

Nobody around to make you safe
Stand strong and you will grow Ooh

Ooh
Wait til they see your smile Don't they love to see you down

See they say things they don't know Ooh

Wait til they see your smile Ooh
Wait til you see my smile
Ooh
Wait til they see your smile If war is holy and sex is obscene
We've got it twisted in this lucid dream
Baptized in boundaries, schooled in sin
Divided by difference, sexuality and skin Oh, so we can hate each other and fear each other
We can build these walls between each other
Baby, blow by blow and brick by brick
Keep yourself locked in, yourself locked in
Yeah, we can hate each other and fear each other
We can build these walls between each other
Baby, blow by blow and brick by brick
Keep yourself locked in, yourself locked Oh, maybe we should love somebody
Oh, maybe we could care a little more
So maybe we should love somebody
Instead of polishing the bombs of holy war What if sex was holy and war was obscene
And it wasn't twisted, what a wonderful dream
Living for love, unafraid of the end
Forgiveness is the only real revenge Oh, so we can heal each other and fill each other
We can break these walls between each other
Baby, blow by blow and brick by brick
Keep yourself open, yourself open
Yeah, we can heal each other and fill each other
We can break these walls between each other
Baby, blow by blow and brick by brick
Keep yourself open, you're open So maybe we should love somebody
Maybe we could care a little more
So maybe we should love somebody
Instead of polishing the bombs of holy war What if love is holy and hate obscene
We should give life to this beautiful dream
'Cause peace and love ain't so far
If we nurse our wounds before they scar
Nurse our wounds before they scar There will never come a day
You will ever hear me say
That I want, or need to be without you
I wanna give my all Baby just hold me
Sweetly control me
Because your arms
they keep away the lonely When I look into your eyes
Then I realize
All I need is you in my life
All I need is you in my life 'Cause I never felt this way about loving
No
Never felt so alive
Baby
Never felt this way about loving
It feels so good And everybody know the story of David and Goliath
But this is bigger than triumph
This is for the warrior, this is for you and I
This is for euphoria, give me a piece of mind
God is recording this! won't you look in the sky?
Tell him you got the behavior of your neighbor
Even when stability's never in your favor
Fly with the turbulence, only last a minute
Land on your dreams, and recognize you live it
Walk through the valley of peace, with bare feet
Run through the flames, that's more passion for me
I passed that, this morning just so the world can see
Got them wolves on me, no watch me like em clean
I know, i know, my pride, my ghost, my eyes
My lows, i know i know, its mind control
I know i could prosper, no impostor
Prosecute my posture
I stand up and I stand by it what I am a freedom fighter, the name that history wrote
And even through disaster, eye of the tiger for hope
I'm trying to find my way back, there's no day off for heroes
And even when I'm tired, gold is the only word i know And the night is takin' over
And the moonlight gets exposure
And the players have been chosen
And it seems like fate has spoken
When it seems your faith has broken
By the second, losin' focus
Ain't no way to get off, get off, get off, get off
Unless you
I bet you wonder how I go on Ill simply say its on again, its on again
The world don't stop, it's on again I am a lonely hero, trying to fight my battles
Life likes to blow the cold wind, sometimes it freezes my shadow
In the midst of all this darkness, i sacrifice my ego
There is no room for selfish, we do it for the people And the night is takin' over
And the moonlight gets exposure
And the players have been chosen
And it seems like fate has spoken
When it seems your faith has broken
By the second, losin' focus
Ain't no way to get off, get off, get off, get off
Unless you
I bet you wonder how I go on The work don't stop, 'cause they don't stop
And everybody here trying to get on top
Everybody from the burbs down to the block
Gotta hold on tight and don't let go, let go
Nah
So you think you're hot?
Gotta grind hard, give it all you got
You can have, or you can have not
You see that a lot in the ghetto (ghetto) And the night is takin' over
And the moonlight gets exposure
And the players have been chosen
And it seems like fate has spoken
When it seems your faith has broken
By the second, losin' focus
Ain't no way to get off, get off, get off, get off
Unless you
I bet you wonder how I go on Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power, yeah
Some people live just to play the game Some people think that the physical things define what's within
And I've been there before, and that life's a bore
So full of the superficial Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, yeah Some people search for a fountain
That promises forever young
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way to prove you love them Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be
With no one to share, with no one who truly cares for me Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything

You would know all everybody talk about is who got beef
Who snitchin', who told police
Who came home, who still gone, who restin' in peace Now they killin' over music money, not drugs, rap replaced it
Because thugs with no brains got no patience
New jacks I pistol whip 'em with the funky rhythm I be kickin'
Musician and flatten composition A pain, I'm like Saddam Hussein
Still alive lookin' at his dead children's burnt remains
I burnt the game, learnt you lames a new lesson
Your crew's soft man, ya'll need some new weapons The P's breathe Warriorz and skullies and Timmies
Around mixed, spics, niggaz and giddies
From my ghetto kings in deep thought we don't blink
But don't think we wastin' our time
It's a New York State of Mind New York, New York, New York
New York City, whoa oh
New York, New York, New York
New York City, baby It's like a jungle, out here
So much struggle, out here
And my dream's still unphased
Greed still the cousin of death Always feels like always somethin' farther time
In the Streets of New York All I see is street homes
And who it's holdin', our people
Only comforts the brain
It's like I'm going insane The revolution has to start, don't waste no time
In the Streets of New York (New York state of mind)
C'mon New York, New York, New York, New York oh
State of mind (New York City)

Big dreams (New York City)
New York, New York, New York, New York oh
Big schemes Oh, it's like the game

Baby loves and girls with no shame
Can't get away (get away), epidemic plague
Every hood in every state
Don't have no reasons 'cause relief is hard to find In the streets of New York (New York state of mind)
In the streets of New York (New York state of mind)
In the streets of New York (New York state of mind)
In the streets of New York (New York state of mind) I'm from the home of a million legends and trend settin'
A lot of footsteps to follow, I've been steppin'
Mind stressin' tryin' to find a record crime shreddin'
Time precious, I ain't have rest since nine eleven I live fast, hustle like today is my last
I get cash, the struggle's like a day on the Ave.
Crack bein' raw, gats squeezin' off
Manhattan squeezin' off, from cats who tease with war The eve of the Apocalypse, evil keep movin' politics
Every block is at risk, the metropolitan metropolis
The opposite of Liza Minelli and Frank Sinatra
Alicia Keys, Nas and Ra the gangsta's opera So New York City walk with me, talk gritty

Here the man come with the anthem, hands up

When the risk it took to remain tightly closed in a bud
Was more painfully than the risk it took to bloom
This is the element of freedom I'll make the darkness light before you,
What is wrong I'll make it right before you,
All the battles I will fight down for you,
And the high place I'll bring down. And the high place I'll bring down. Mm, bye bye How do you love someone
That hurts you, oh, so bad
With intentions good?
Was all he ever had Well, how do I let go when I've loved him for so long
And I've given him all that I could? Maybe love is a hopeless crime
Giving up what seems your lifetime
What went wrong with something once so good? How do you find the words to say
To say, to say (to say goodbye) goodbye

When your heart don't have the heart to say
To say, to say (to say goodbye) goodbye

From the good man that he is Well, how do I let go when I've
Loved him for so long and I've
Given him all that I could? Was it something wrong that we did?
Or 'cause others infiltrated?
What went wrong with something once so good? How do you find the words to say
To say, to say (to say goodbye) goodbye
(Find the words to say goodbye)
When your heart don't have the heart to say
To say goodbye
Find the words to say goodbye) Is this the end? Are you sure?
How should you know
When you've never been here before?
It's so hard to just let go
And this is the one and only love I've ever known, so (How do you find the words to say, to say goodbye
When your heart don't have the heart to say
When your heart don't have the heart to say
To say goodbye
Find the words to say goodbye) How do you find the words to say
To say goodbye When I wake up in the morning baby

There are sirens all around
And the streets are mean
If I could make it here
I could make it anywhere
That's what they say
Seeing my face in lights
Or my name in marquees found down Broadway Even if it ain't all it seems
I got a pocketful of dreams
Baby, I'm from [Chorus]
New York, concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York, New York, New York On the avenue, there ain't never a curfew
Ladies work so hard
Such a melting pot on the corner selling rock
Preachers pray to God
Hail a gypsy cab
Takes me down from Harlem to the Brooklyn Bridge
Someone sleeps tonight with a hunger
For more than from an empty fridge I'm going to make it by any means
I got a pocketful of dreams
Baby, I'm from [Chorus: x2] One hand in the air for the big city
Street lights, big dreams, all looking pretty
No place in the world that can compared
Put your lighters in the air
Everybody say yeah, yeah yeah [Chorus] Oh, oh, A-K!
New day
Oh, oh, A-K!
Ow! Party people say, party people say, "Aye
It's a new day, it's a new day"
World is gettin' ready, everybody's ready, yeah!
For a new day, for a new day,
Celebrate and say aye, aye, aye, aye aye (aye) It's alright to, to feel however you want to
There's no limitation, no
Fill up your life, let me see your hands up one time
We'll celebrate mine, 'cause I ain't gonna get no more
So we can do this all night, one time
Everybody say, "Aye aye oh" (oh) There's a feeling that I got that I can't give up
Feeling in my heart that I can't get over
I know that it's coming, let the sun come up
Tell me do you feel the same? Everybody say Party people say, party people say, "Aye
It's a new day, it's a new day"
World is gettin' ready, everybody's ready, yeah!
For a new day, for a new day,
Celebrate and say aye, aye, aye, aye aye (aye) Take a look in my eyes, can't you see I'm ready,
Aye, come alive let's get it
Aye, if you wanna touch the sky, hands in the air one time
All night and all day
I'mma live it loud like there's only one life left to live it up
One life left to live it up There's a feeling that I got that I can't give up
Feeling in my heart that I can't get over
I know that it's coming, let the sun come up
Tell me do you feel the same? Everybody say Party people say, party people say, "Aye

(Celebrate) and say Check it out
It feels kinda crazy These covers
May keep me warm at night
But they can't take your place
'Cause they never gonna hold me tight And these pillows
May let me rest my head
But they can't say good night
And tuck me in before I go to bed Say now baby girl you're better off
That's what I'm telling myself (over and over)
But I'm lying to myself
'Cause I know I don't want nobody else These lips are missin' you
'Cause these lips ain't kissin' you
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win
These arms are wantin' you
'Cause these arms ain't holdin' you
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win These candles
Light up my room at night
But they can't light the room they way you did
When you walked inside, oh baby If these walls could sing
About everything they've witnessed
Oh it'd be a sad sad song
And it'll probably sound something like this Say now baby girl you're better off
That's what I'm telling myself (over and over)
But I'm lying to myself
Cause I know I don't want nobody else 'Cause these lips are missin' you (Missin' you)
'Cause these lips ain't kissin' you (Kissin' you)
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win
These arms are wantin' you (Wantin' you)
'Cause these arms ain't holdin' you (Holdin' you)
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win Tell me when the hell this loneliness is gonna be over (Gonna be over)
When everything in this room reminds me of you (You)
Every time I think, I'm getting closer
'Cause tears drown me out, once again I lose 'Cause these lips are missin' you (Missin' you)
'Cause these lips ain't kissin' you (Kissin' you)
I put up a fight
But once again these tears always win
These arms are wantin' you (Wantin' you)
'Cause these arms ain't holdin' you (Holdin' you)
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win Crying like oh oh
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win
Crying like oh oh
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win And it feels so good
Don't you feel so good?
Talk to me Hey, I never been this good, not ever, not ever
Never seen this part of me
I know that nothing last forever, however
Oh, I'm not worried about tomorrow
Cause tomorrow may not come
And where my heart take me I follow, you gotta follow When they lay me down, put my soul to rest
When they ask me how I spent my life
At least I got to love you, when it's all over
When it's all said and done, when it's all over
At least I got to love you, at least I got to love you Hey, ask when I wanna leave
A lifelong legacy, me loving you and you loving me
Oh, I'm not worried about tomorrow, tomorrow
All I know, all the time we have is borrowed, I feel no sorrow When they lay me down, put my soul to rest
When they ask me how I spent my life
At least I got to love you, when it's all over
When it's all said and done, when it's all over
At least I got to love you, at least I got to love you Everybody say hey hey hey hey If I do nothing else, oh

Everybody say hey hey hey hey I'm just tryna hold onto to a dream
Out here lost and nothing's what it seems
I'm just tryna find where I belong
This must be the dark before the dawn
When the place that you were born is not where you belong
Tell me baby, what stops you from wearing a crown?
I wanna be somebody, be somebody
And I wanna go somewhere, go somewhere Back to life, life, life, life, life, life, life, baby

Everybody wants to be adored
You don't have to settle for being enough Back to life
Back to life
Nothing can break you
I will survive
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Back to life I'm not made to be locked up
If a bird don't fly, then what were wings made for?

And if I don't try, then what was I made for? Back to life
Bck to life
Nothing can break you
I will survive
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Back to life Right now I feel like a bird
caged without a key
Ev'ryone comes to stare at me
with so much joy and reverie
They don't know how I feel inside
Through my smile I cry They don't know what they're doing to me
keeping me from flying
That's why I say that I know why
the caged bird sings
Only joy comes from song She's so rare and beautiful to others
Why not just set her free
so she can fly, fly, fly
spreading her wings and her song?
Let her fly, fly, fly
the whole world to see She's like a caged bird
Fly, fly, ooh, just let her fly
just let her fly, just let her fly
spread her wings

Drop it on me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let's do it like this, uh If I was your woman
And you were my man
You'd have no other woman
You'd be weak as a lamb If you had the strength
To walk out my door
My love would over-rule my sense
And I'd call you back for more If I was your woman
If I was your woman
And you were my man, yeah She tears you down darling
Says you're nothing at all
But I'll pick you up darling
When she lets you fall 'Cause you're like a diamond
But she treats you like glass
Yet you beg her to love you
But me you won't ask If I were your woman
If I were your woman
If I was your woman Here's what I'd do
I'd never, never, no, no, no stop loving you
Yeah, yeah Life is so crazy
And love is unkind
Because she was first darling
Will she hang on your mind You're a part of me
But you don't even know it
I'm what you need
But I'm too afraid to show it If I were your woman
If I were your woman
If I were your woman Here's what I'd do
I'd never, never, no, no, no stop loving you If I were your woman
Here's what I'd do
I'd never, never, never stop loving you
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I were your woman
I were your woman
I were your woman
I were your woman
I were your woman We're at the crossroads, my dear
Where do we go from here?
Maybe you won't go, maybe you'll stay
Oh I know I'm gonna miss you either ways
It's such a lonely road [Chorus: x2]
Where do we go from here?
All I can do is, follow the tracks of my tears
Oh
When I cry your name
Am I crawling in bed
Oh and am I waiting only to drown in pain
Oh
Don't you do it
No, said don't you leave me this way
I don't know
If I can lift my head and face another day
Ooh it's such a lonely road Where do we go from here?
All I can do is, follow the tracks of my tears
You seem now the kind of girl who's lost and looking for direction
(Who could this be? Staring at me)
When I'm looking in the mirror trying to find a resolution
(Me too far gone, to find my way home) [Chorus] Where do we go from here?
All I can do is, follow the tracks of my tears Is it my turn to wish you was lying here?
I tend to dream you when I'm not sleeping
Is it my turn to fictionalize my world?
Or even imagine your emotions, tell myself anything Is it my turn to take you by your hands?
Tell you, I love you and you not hear me
Is it my turn to totally understand?
Watch you walk out of my life and not do a damn thing If I have to give away, every feeling that I feel,
If I have to sacrifice, oh, whatever babe, whatever baby
If I have to take apart, all that I am
Is there anything that I would not do, inside I'd die without you
Inside I'd die without you, yeah babe Oh I apologize for all the things I've done
Now I'm underwater and I'm drowning
Is it my turn to be the one to cry?
Isn't it amazing how some things completely turn around?
Oh, take every little piece of my heart (Piece of my heart)
Take every little piece of my soul (Piece of my soul)
Take every little piece of my mind
'Cause if you're gone, inside, I'd die without you Yeah 'cause inside I'd die without you
Yeah baby I'd die without you
Can't you see that I would die without you? If I have to give away, every feeling that I feel,
If I have to sacrifice, oh, whatever babe, whatever baby
If I have to take apart, all that I am
Is there anything that I would not do, inside I'd die without you Yeah I'd die without you
Oh don't you know that I would, die without you
Baby, see I would die without, I'd die without you
Oh die without you, die without you babe
I don't know what I'd do without you babe Have you ever felt so strong
That may you feel weak
Long days
Long nights

I'll give you all of my time Sometimes I feel
Like I don't belong anywhere
And it's gonna take so long
For me to get somewhere
Sometimes I feel
So heavy hearted
But I can't explain
Cause I'm so guarded But that's a lonely road to travel
And a heavy load to bare
And it's a long, long way to heaven
But I gotta get there
Can you send an angel?
Can you send me an angel?
Guide me In the morning when you wake
When I wanna face today and all your heartache
Thinking how much can you take
Please don't ever loose a faith and don't fall under In a world that seems to get colder and colder
Don't you worry cause
My love will only get stronger and stronger Cause I I I I I'm gonna love you gonna hold ya through it all
I I I I'm gonna love you gonna never let you fall
Through it all
Through it all Don't think about the past, don't worry bout the future
Just live in the moment
Long as there's another day here will be another way
A chance to make it through In a world that seems to get colder and colder
Don't you worry cause
My love will only get stronger and stronger Cause I I I I I'm gonna love you gonna hold ya through it all
I I I I'm gonna love you gonna never let you fall
Through it all When you're down and out
Loosing dignity
Don't let go of me (hold on)
Surely there's is a brighter day right in front of me (hold on)
If you really looked inside
You would finally realize
You don't have to cry (no more)
All you have to do is see
That you can believe in me
And I will never leave Cause I I I I I'm gonna love you gonna hold ya through it all
I I I I'm gonna love you gonna never let you fall
Through it all Remembering the days when our love began
Thinkin' of a million ways
To escape and be with you
But reality wasn't just you and I
It was long drawn out days and lonely nights Dreamin' bout you
I keep dreamin' bout you
When I'm dreamin' bout when you would say [Chorus]
Let me take you to another place
Where nothing ever seems to matter
Its just you and me
We can take flight like a thief in the night
Stolen moments with you (oh oh) Destiny didn't have such a simple plan (simple plan)
I was just a girl and you a young man
How could age define
Something so divine (so divine)
Can this even be real or just exist in my mind Dreamin' bout you
I keep dreamin' 'bout you
When I'm dreamin' 'bout when you would say [Chorus] Dreamin' bout you
I keep dreamin' bout you
When I'm dreamin and waiting for the day
When no one and nothing else takes up our time
Finally you're only mine Each and everyday
I don't walk with you right by my side
But instead we have to hide
Sneak around and lie
Just to spend time alone
This lovin is a crime
I'd rather do the time
And leave the world behind [Chorus] Let's get away
Let's get away
Oh oh We can get away
We can get away
Oh oh Let's get away
Let's get away
Oh oh We can get away
We can get away
Oh oh Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now
Look around, look around Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now
Look around, look around Look at where you are
Look at where you started
The fact that you're alive is a miracle
Just stay alive
That would be enough And if this child
Shares a fraction of your smile
Or a fragment of your mind, look out world!
That would be enough I don't pretend to know
The challenges you're facing
The worlds you keep erasing and creating in your mind But I'm not afraid
I know who I married
So long as you come home at the end of the day
That would be enough We don't need a legacy
We don't need money
If I could grant you peace of mind
If you could let me inside your heart Oh, let me be a part of the narrative
In the story they will write someday
Let this moment be the first chapter:
Where you decide to stay And I would be enough
And this could be enough
This would be enough Said, I would be enough
And this could be enough
See, we could be enough
Oh baby I could be enough
We could be enough
This could be enough
Ooh Don't look no further
Don't go nowhere
I could be enough (I could be enough)
We could have it all Tell me baby (baby)
Can you feel me? (ay)
Can I be enough? (Can I be enough?)
And your family? (Me and your family?)
Listen, baby (Listen, baby)
We can have it all (We could have it all)
Can I be enough? (Can I be enough?)
Yeah
Woo So look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now
Look around, look around Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now
Look around, look around
Baby
Darling
Ooh Let's go back in time
When seeing your ID on mine
Made me crazy
Ooh baby I'm saying Let's go back there
Let's take it there
I'm talking bout

That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me, it isn't over Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me, it isn't over Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste? Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
[Clean version:] Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
[Explicit version:] Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare
See how I leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch
And it's bringing me out the dark The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it, to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you
And I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there
As mine sure won't be shared (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love remind me of us
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
I can't help feeling
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it, to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it, with a beating Throw your soul through every open door (woah)
Count your blessings to find what you look for (woah)
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (woah)
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow (woah)
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could have had it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
It all, it all, it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me) But you played it
You played it
You played it
You played it to the beat. Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet There's such a difference between us
And a million miles Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly
Doesn't tear you apart anymore Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened? It's no secret
That the both of us
Are running out of time So hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly
Doesn't tear you apart anymore Oh, anymore
Oh, anymore
Oh, anymore
Anymore Hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly
Doesn't tear you apart anymore I will leave my heart at the door
I won't say a word
They've all been said before you know
So why don't we just play pretend
Like we're not scared of what's coming next
Or scared of having nothing left Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again? I don't need your honesty
It's already in your eyes
And I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that matters
Tell me who do I run to? Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again? Let this be our lesson in love
Let this be the way we remember us
I don't wanna be cruel or vicious
And I ain't asking for forgiveness
All I ask is If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again? I let it fall, my heart,
And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands, they're strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cry
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name When laying with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here, forever
You and me together, nothing gets better Cause there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Where I felt something die, 'cause I knew that
That was the last time, the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door
As if that heart you caught is still waiting for you
Even now when it's already over
I can't help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Where I felt something die
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time, oh
Oh, oh Let it burn, oh
Let it burn
Let it burn Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk
To the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home
You're like a dream come true
But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment
Before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song I was so scared to face my fears
Nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swore you moved overseas
That's what you said, when you left me You still look like a movie
You still sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young It's hard to win me back
Everything just takes me back
To when you were there
To when you were there
And a part of me keeps holding on
Just in case it hasn't gone
I guess I still care
Do you still care? It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old
It makes me reckless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
When we were young Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am home again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am whole again Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am young again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am fun again However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I will always love you Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am free again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am clean again However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I will always love you However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
'Cause I love you When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
no doubt in my mind were you belong I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the Earth for you
To make you feel my love To make you feel my love I've made up my mind
Don't need to think it over
If I'm wrong I am right
Don't need to look no further
This ain't lust
I know this is love but If I tell the world
I'll never say enough
Cause it was not said to you
And that's exactly what I need to do
If I'm in love with you Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste?
Even If I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere I'd build myself up
And fly around in circles
Waiting as my heart drops
And my back begins to tingle
Finally could this be it or Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste?
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere yeah Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if, it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste?
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up,
Or should I just keep on chasing pavements?
Should I just keep on chasing pavements? Or Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste?
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements
