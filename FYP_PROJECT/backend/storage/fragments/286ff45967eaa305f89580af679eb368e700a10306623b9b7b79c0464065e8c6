de the river I cried,
And lay yourself down.
Look how you want me now that I don't need you. So, you thought that I'd crumble to my knees
At the first sight of you crawling back to me
To whisper "will you leave your man? "
Cause you swear that this time you can stand by me.
I won't stand by you. Cause I found a boy who I love more,
Than I ever did you before,
So stand beside the river I cried
And lay yourself down.
Look how you want me now that I don't need you! I ain't yours for no taking,
You must be mistaken
I could never look into your eyes, and settle for wrong
And ignore the right When I found a boy who loves me more,
Than you ever did me before.
So stand beside the river you cried
And lay yourself down!
Look how you want me now that I don't need you! Found myself today singing out your name,
You said I'm crazy,
If I am I'm crazy for you. Sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here
Turns me crazy,
But it's you who makes me lose my head. And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head
And turn me into a crumbling fool. Tell me to run and I'll race,
If you want me to stop I'll freeze,
And if you want me gone. I'll leave, just hold me closer baby,
And make me crazy for you.
Crazy for you. Lately with this state I'm in I can't help myself but spin.
I wish you'd come over,
Send me spinning closer to you. My oh my, how my blood boils, it's sweet taste for you,
Strips me down bare
And gets me into my favorite mood. I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away,
But the more I do,
The crazier I turn into. Pacing floors and opening doors,
Hoping you'll walk through
And save me boy,
Because I'm too crazy for you.
Crazy for you Everybody tells me it's 'bout time that I moved on
And I need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young
But my heart is a valley, it's so shallow and man made
I'm scared to death if I let you in that you'll see I'm just a fake
Sometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch
But I know that's just me, 'cause nothing ever is enough
When I was a child I grew up by the River Lea
There was something in the water, now that something's in me
Oh I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river But it's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain But it's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea I should probably tell you now before it's way too late
That I never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face
Consider this my apology, I know it's years in advance
But I'd rather say it now in case I never get the chance
No, I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river But it's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain It's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea I never woulda hitch-hiked to Birmingham
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda caught the train to Louisiana
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda run through the blindin' rain
Without one dollar to my name
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love I never woulda seen the trouble that I'm in
If it hadn't been for love
Woulda been gone like a wayward wind
If it hadn't been for love
Nobody knows it better than me
I wouldn't be wishing I was free
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love Four cold walls against my will
At least I know he's lying still
Four cold walls without parole
Lord have mercy on my soul Four cold walls against my will
At least I know he's lying still
Four cold walls without parole
Lord have mercy on my soul I never woulda hitch-hiked to Birmingham
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda caught the train to Louisiana
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda loaded up a forty-four
Put myself behind a jailhouse door
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love, yes
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love, yes Hold my hand while you cut me down
It had only just begun but now it's over now
And you're in the heat of moments with your heart playing up cold
I'm between the middle watching hastiness unfold
On my eyes you were smiling in the spotlight dancing with the night
The night
When I fell off your mind I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Oy, I'm tired Where'd you go when you stayed behind
I looked up and inside down and outside only to find
A double taking punching hard and laughing at my smile
I get closer you obviously prefer her I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Oy, I'm tired (I should have known) Never mind said your open arms
I couldn't help believe they tricked me back into them, even though I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Oy, I'm tired Who wants to be right as rain
It's better when something is wrong
You get excitement in your bones
And everything you do's a game
When night comes and you're on your own
You can say I chose to be alone
Who wants to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top 'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love Who wants to be riding high
When you'll just crumble back on down
You give up everything you are
And even then you don't get far
They make believe that everything
Is exactly what it seems
But at least when you're at your worst
You know how to feel things 'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love Go ahead and still my heart
To make me cry again
'Cause it will never hurt
As much as it did then
We were both right
And no one had blame
But now I give up
On this endless game 'Cause who wants to be right as rain
It's better when something is wrong
I get excitement in my bones
Even though everything's a strain
When night comes and I'm on my own
You should know I chose to be alone
Who wants to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top 'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love No room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love So little to say but so much time
Despite my empty mouth the words are in my mind
Please wear the face, the one where you smile
Because you lighten up my heart when I start to cry Forgive me first love, but I'm tired
I need to get away to feel again
Try to understand why, don't get so close to change my mind
Please wipe that look out of your eyes, it's bribing me to doubt myself
Simply, it's tiring This love has dried up and stayed behind
And if I stay I'll be alive
Then choke on words I'd always hide
Excuse me first love, but we're through
I need to taste the kiss from someone new Forgive me first love, but I'm too tired
I'm bored to say the least and I, I lack desire
Forgive me first love, forgive me first love, forgive me first love
Forgive me first love forgive me, forgive me first love, forgive me first love This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the earth move and then
Hear my heart burst again For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen Let the skyfall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together Let the skyfall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall
At skyfall Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number, you can take my name
But you'll never have my heart Let the skyfall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together Let the skyfall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together
At skyfall [x2:]
(Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall) Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me
Without the security
Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand Let the skyfall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together Let the skyfall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together
At skyfall Let the sky fall
We will stand tall
At skyfall This is how the story went
I met someone by accident
It blew me away
Blew me away It was in the darkest of my days
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
And buried them away, you buried them away I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away Dropped you off at the train station
Put a kiss on top of your head
Watch you wave
And watched you wave Then I went on home to my skyscrapers
And neon lights and waiting papers
That I call home
I call that home I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away, away Woke up feeling heavy-hearted
I'm going back to where I started
The morning rain, the morning rain
And though I wish that you were here
On that same old road that brought me here
It's calling me home, It's calling me home I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away
I can't spend my whole life hiding my heart away Right under my feet there's air made of bricks
Pulls me down turns me weak for you
I find myself repeating like a broken tune
And I'm forever excusing your intentions
That I give in to my pretendings
Which forgive you each time
Without me knowing
They melt my heart to stone And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love Each and every time I turn around to leave
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
So desperately I try to link it with my head
But instead I fall back to my knees
As you tear your way right through me
I forgive you once again
Without me knowing
You've burnt my heart to stone And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love Why do you steal my hand
Whenever I'm standing my own ground
You build me up, then leave me dead I hear your words you made up
I say your name like there should be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one, in love
I'm the only one in love Fool that I am for falling in love with you
And fool that I am for thinking you loved me too You took my heart then played the part of little coquette
And my dreams just disappeared like the smoke from a cigarette Fool that I am for hoping you'd understand
And thinking you would listen to all of the things
The things I had planned But we couldn't see eye to eye
So darling
Darling
Darling this is goodbye Oh
I still care
Fool that I am
Ooh
I still care
Fool that I am You say it's all in my head
And the things I think just don't make sense
So where you been then? Don't go all coy
Don't turn it round on me like it's my fault
See I can see that look in your eyes
The one that shoots me each and every time You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her These days when I see you
You make it look like I'm see-through
Do tell me why you waste our time
When your heart ain't in it, and you're not satisfied
You know I know just how you feel
I'm starting to find myself feeling that way too When you grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her Time and time again, I play the role of fool
(Just for you)
Even in the daylight when you think that
(I don't see you)
Try to look for things I hear but our eyes never find
Though I do know how you play You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her [Adele]
Why do you love me
Do you love me...?
Why do you love me
Do you love me?
Why do you love me
Do you love me? Why do you love me...? Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me? Why do you love me?
There must be something in the water
Cause baby I'm in deeper than I knew
How do you keep me coming back for more
After all we've been through
I can't decide if I should run and hide It's above and beyond me
It's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy
It's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me... Who knows why I love you
It could be something in the air I breath
Whatever it is, I depend on it
Where does the time go?
I spend every single moment daydreaming of you
I can't describe how I feel, it feels right It's above and beyond me
It's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy
It's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me You were a shock in the dark that blew me away
And you left your mark and it never will fade
You ignited a spark, let the fires away
Are you ready, ready?
You have a place in my heart that will always be yours
You are the peak and art of my universe
Every piece and part, you were the first
I am ready, ready It's above and beyond me,
It's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you It's above and beyond me,
It's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me... Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me? You said I'm stubborn and I never give in
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that
I think you're giving out in way too much in fact
I say we've only known each other a year
You say I've known you longer my dear
You like to be so close, I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
Walking with each other,
Think we'll never match at all, but we do
But we do, but we do, but we do I thought I knew myself, somehow you know me more
I've never known this, never before
You're the first to make up whenever we argue
I don't know who I'd be if I didn't know you
You're so provocative, I'm so conservative
You're so adventurous, I'm so very cautious, combining
You think we would and we do,
But we do, but we do, but we do Favoritism ain't my thing but,
In this situation I'll be glad Favoritism ain't my thing but,
In this situation I'll be glad to make an exception You said I'm stubborn and I never give in
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that
I think you're giving out in way too much in fact
I say we've only known each other one year
You say I've known you longer my dear
You like to be so close, I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
Walking with each other,
Think we'll never match at all, but we do In the darkness of my heart is a shadow of your face
From the deepest part of my regret
I hear the words I wish I'd said
At the dawning of the day
I can't wait to see the light
Make up memories in my head
They help to fill the emptiness you've left
I can't drown in your tears
I won't face your fears
I need to fight my own
You'll never see me again oh baby in time
Let the weight take me under
I know I'll survive
You'll never see me again At the dawning of the day
I can't bare to see the light
Make up memories in my head
They help to fill the emptiness you've left
I can't drown in your tears
I won't face your fears
I need to fight my own
You'll never see me again oh baby in time
Let the weight take me under
I know I'll survive Let the floor beneath of me fall
Let the sky come crashing down
Turn all my right to wrong
But after you that goes on
You'll never see me again
I've been learning to live without you
It's taken all of my stake
But I'm stronger now You'll never see me again oh baby in time
Let the weight take me under
I know I'll survive Let the floor beneath of me fall
Let the sky come crashing down
Turn all my right to wrong
But after you that goes on
You'll never see me again
You'll never see me again
You'll never see me again I want to see your face in every kind of light
In fields of dawn and forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make What are you doing the rest of your life?
North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me I want to see your face in every kind of light
In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes
In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes
It may take a kiss or two Through all of my life
Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall of my life
All I ever will recall of my life
Is all of my life with you Wait, do you see my heart on my sleeve?
It's been there for days on end and
It's been waiting for you to open up
Yours too baby, come on now
I'm trying to tell you just how
I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally
Say that it's always been me That's made you feel the way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last
Like I'm the one for you You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me
Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me Why is it every time I think I've tried my hardest
It turns out it ain't enough
You're still not mentioning love
What am I supposed to do to make you want me properly?
I'm taking these chances and getting nowhere
And though I'm trying my hardest you go back to her
And I think that I know things may never change
I'm still hoping one day I might hear you say I make you feel the way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last
Like I'm the one for you You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me
Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me But, despite the truth that I know
I find it hard to let go and give up on you
Seems I love the things you do
Like the meaner you treat me the more eager I am
To persist with this heartbreak and running around
And I will do until I'm finding myself you And make you feel a way you've never felt before
And be all you need so that you never want more
And you'll say all of the right things without a clue
And you'll be the one for me and me the one for you I let it fall, my heart,
And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands, they're strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,
Your name When I lay with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together nothing gets better 'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name,
Your name I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Well, it felt something died
'Cause I knew that that was
The last time, the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door,
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,
Your name I set fire to the rain,
And I threw us into the flames
Well, it felt something died
'Cause I knew that, that was the last time
The last time Let it burn
Let it burn
Let it burn [Adele]
I would never lie to you unless you tell me to...
Every part of me
All my words to hold
And hold against me
Why won't you let it be? Don't you ever say my love opened up your heart
No I'm not gonna do it standing up
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby
Won't you turn off the lights Lay me down
'til the morning!
Lay me down (through the night)
Lay me down (I can fall in)
Lay me down (Won't you)
Lay me down (I can baby)
Lay me down (Someone believe me) I would never break the rules unless you tell me to
You can read my mind, be it truth or lies
Lie down beside me, why won't you let it be? Don't you ever say my love opened up your heart
No I'm not gonna do it standing up
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights Lay me down ('til the morning)
Lay me down (through the night)
Lay me down (I can fall in)
Lay me down (Won't you)
Lay me down (I can baby)
Lay me down (Someone believe me) Lay down with me
Lay down with me
Lay down with me
Lay down with me Words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights Lay me down ('til the morning)
Lay me down (through the night)
Lay me down (I can fall in)
Lay me down (Won't you)
Lay me down (I can baby)
Lay me down
Someone believe me Never been a girl who used to cry
Didn`t show emotions, don`t know why
Didn`t wanna feel the pain inside, I guess But as the years keep going by,
you came along and changed my mind
I should leave the past behind me,
I should let you find me,
supposed to stay beside me
You were supposed to guide me,
through the ups and downs,
you were always gonna be around until the end I still think we could
`cause you and me, we`re good
And I`ll tell you why this hurts, 'cause I`m sober But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has put me through
Even when I've had too much,
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough So I pour myself another drink
whenever I start to think about you
`cause I do but I really don`t want to
but sometimes my dreams just come through And when I get there,
to a place where I see you in a kitchen
I start wishing for that thing and I don`t need you,
I don`t really wanna see you
and I don`t want you to see me,
you would think that I was crazy,
you might think that I wanna be close to you
but I`d rather wanna drink some Whisky
and maybe have a little sip `o wine
`cause right now it`s the only thing that makes me forget you were mine
but right now I am sober But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has put me through
Even when I've had too much,
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough I still think we could
(I`m not drunk enough)
`cause you and me, we`re good
`cause I`m sober But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has put me through
Even when I've had too much,
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough (I still think we could)
But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has put me through
(`cause you and me we`re good)
Even when I've had too much,
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough Think I've had enough
I must my way
I've fallen off the edge to find that I've gone blind
You're leading me astray
You haunt me like a ghost
And that scares me the most
There you are the devil on my shoulder
Smiling as the flames are growing colder
How can I believer what I have?
For a little confidence I'll grab But when my hand goes out don't take it for I'm trying to make it on my own
I fell it in my bones any minute now!
This train of thought will leave the statio
My impatience will come out to play
You've turned out to be the only face I see!
Running through the empty hallways I can tell that I am not alone You spin a web in every room
You spin a web in every room
And try to break the backbone that I've grown
Will I make my own path or wander where I'm thrown
Will I make my own path or wander where I'm thrown
Or wander where I'm thrown? When we used
To say goodnight
I'd always kiss
And hold you tight
But lately
You don't seem
To care
You close the door
And leave me
Standing there
Oh, honey
That's not fair
That's it
I quit
I'm movin' on The other night
We had a date
An you showed up
Two hours late
And though your hair
Was all in place
Somebody smeared
Their lipstick
On your face
Oh, they smeared it
Every place
Ye that's it honey
I quit I'm movin' on [Chorus]
You made me want you
You made me leave you
You made me tumble
And fall
But if I
Can't have you the way
I want you
I don't want you at all Baby, I can take a lot
'Cause I love
Everything you got
Though your kisses
Fill me
So if you got
Someone else
I gotta go
Oh, that you know
Ye that's it honey
I quit I'm movin' on [Chorus] Baby
I can take a lot
'Cause I love
Everything you got
Though your kisses
Fill me
So if you got
Someone else
I gotta go
Oh, that you know
So that's it baby
I quit I'm movin' on
Ye that's it baby
I quit now
I'm movin' on Don't ask me
What you know is true
Don't have to tell you
I love your precious heart I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never tear us apart We could live
For a thousand years
But if I hurt you
I'd make wine from your tears I told you
That we could fly
'Cause we all have wings
But some of us don't know why I
I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never ever tear us apart I know sometimes you're scared of the light
But how will you ever know if you never try
There's something new inside my heart
And it grabs like a child whenever we're apart
I see your face under every sky
I find the less I look, more I find
So let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want You know sometimes that I'm scared of the dark
But I'm feeling sun babe when I'm in your arms
You said my name in the dead of glory
You hold me alright
When I'm short of falling So let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want There will be times
When we'll try to give it up
Bursting out, it seems no doubt that will almost fall apart than burn to pieces
And we'll watch them turn to dust
But without each other, nothing is easy enough So let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
'cause you're the only one I want, yeah
You're the only one
Never gonna leave you
No, I'm never gonna leave you, no Go ahead, go ahead and smash it on the floor
Take whatever is left, and take it with you out the door
See if I cry
See if I shed a single sorry tear
Can't say that it's been that great
No in fact it's been a wasted worried year [Chorus]
Everybody sees
And everyone agrees
That you and I are wrong
And it's been that way to long
Take it as it comes
And be thankful when it's done
There's so many ways to act
And there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black Let it out, let it all out
Say what's on your mind
You can kick and scream and shout and say things that are so unkind
Yeah-see if I care, see if I stand firm or if I fall
Cause in the back of my mind, and on the tip of my tongue
Is the answer to it all [Chorus] Yeah there's many shades of black [Chorus] Cause there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
Yeah there's any shades of black
There's so many shades of black
Yeah there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
And there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black Go ahead... Last night she said
Oh, baby
I feel so down
Oh, and turned me off
When I feel left out
So I
I turned around
Oh, baby
I don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking
Out that door Well, I've been in town
For just about fifteen
Whole minutes now
Oh, baby, I feel so down
And I don't know why
I keep walking for miles But the people
They don't understand
No, girlfriends
They can't understand
Your grandsons
They won't understand
On top of this
I ain't ever
Gonna understand Last night she said
Oh, baby
Don't feel so down
Oh, and turned me off
When I feel left out
So I, I turned around
Oh, baby
I'm gonna be alright
It was a great big lie
Cuz I left that night
Yeah Oh, people
They don't understand
No, girlfriends
They don't understand
In spaceships
They won't understand
And me
I ain't ever
Gonna understand Last night she said
Oh, baby
I feel so down
She had turned me off
When I feel left out
So I
I turned around
Oh, little girl
I don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking
Out that door, yeah Painting pictures with my mind
Making memories using my eyes
Filling up my heart with golden stories
Who adds some spice to the rhythm of life, oh Welcome sunrise with the morning glory
I've changed my mind
There is no simple
I thought of me, I want to see
I want to feel my heartbeat so
With the world that you feel, leave I can feel the pressure pushing onto my heart
And it's teasing me
To scratch my itch and beat my drum
So I can start to begin what's begun Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories Running riots inside my soul
Fire burning and it's lighting me up
To scratch my itch and beat my drum
So I can finish what has begun Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories Sometimes the hole you left hurts
My heart so bad, it cuts through
The deepest parts of me and fills up my mouth with the words that cry
Out, I'm still trying to stay inside Hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts Our hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts Every now and then my memories ache
With empty ideas of the ones we'd have made it
But as time goes on and my age gets older
I love the ones I know, they're enough to picture the rest 'Cause heart break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts Our hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts You know when to make me, imagine you're here
You know when to make me, imagine you're here
You know when to make me, imagine you're here
You know when to make me, imagine you're here Find yourself a girl

Oh I just want to make love to you Happy New Year! I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me, it isn't over Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me, it isn't over Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste? Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
[Clean version:] Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
[Explicit version:] Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare
See how I leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch
And it's bringing me out the dark The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it, to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you
And I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there
As mine sure won't be shared (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love remind me of us
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
I can't help feeling
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it, to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it, with a beating Throw your soul through every open door (woah)
Count your blessings to find what you look for (woah)
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (woah)
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow (woah)
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could have had it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
It all, it all, it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me) But you played it
You played it
You played it
You played it to the beat. Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet There's such a difference between us
And a million miles Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly
Doesn't tear you apart anymore Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened? It's no secret
That the both of us
Are running out of time So hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly
Doesn't tear you apart anymore Oh, anymore
Oh, anymore
Oh, anymore
Anymore Hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly
Doesn't tear you apart anymore I will leave my heart at the door
I won't say a word
They've all been said before you know
So why don't we just play pretend
Like we're not scared of what's coming next
Or scared of having nothing left Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again? I don't need your honesty
It's already in your eyes
And I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that matters
Tell me who do I run to? Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again? Let this be our lesson in love
Let this be the way we remember us
I don't wanna be cruel or vicious
And I ain't asking for forgiveness
All I ask is If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again? I let it fall, my heart,
And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands, they're strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cry
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name When laying with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here, forever
You and me together, nothing gets better Cause there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Where I felt something die, 'cause I knew that
That was the last time, the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door
As if that heart you caught is still waiting for you
Even now when it's already over
I can't help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Where I felt something die
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time, oh
Oh, oh Let it burn, oh
Let it burn
Let it burn Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk
To the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home
You're like a dream come true
But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment
Before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song I was so scared to face my fears
Nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swore you moved overseas
That's what you said, when you left me You still look like a movie
You still sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young It's hard to win me back
Everything just takes me back
To when you were there
To when you were there
And a part of me keeps holding on
Just in case it hasn't gone
I guess I still care
Do you still care? It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old
It makes me reckless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
When we were young Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am home again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am whole again Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am young again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am fun again However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I will always love you Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am free again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am clean again However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I will always love you However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
'Cause I love you When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
no doubt in my mind were you belong I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the Earth for you
To make you feel my love To make you feel my love I've made up my mind
Don't need to think it over
If I'm wrong I am right
Don't need to look no further
This ain't lust
I know this is love but If I tell the world
I'll never say enough
Cause it was not said to you
And that's exactly what I need to do
If I'm in love with you Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste?
Even If I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere I'd build myself up
And fly around in circles
Waiting as my heart drops
And my back begins to tingle
Finally could this be it or Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste?
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere yeah Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if, it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste?
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up,
Or should I just keep on chasing pavements?
Should I just keep on chasing pavements? Or Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste?
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere When will I see you again?
You left with no goodbye, not a single word was said
No final kiss to seal anything
I had no idea of the state we were in I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head
But don't you remember, don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before,
Baby please remember me once more When was the last time you thought of me?
Or have you completely erased me from your memories?
I often think about where I went wrong
The more I do, the less I know But I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head
But don't you remember, don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby please remember me once more Oh, I gave you the space so you could breathe
I kept my distance so you would be free
In hope that you find the missing piece
To bring you back to me Why don't you remember, don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby please remember me once more
When will I see you again? She, she ain't real
She ain't gonna be able to love you like I will
She is a stranger
You and I have history
Or don't you remember
Sure, she's got it all
But, baby, is that really what you want Bless your soul, you've got you're head in the clouds
You made a fool out of you
And, boy, she's bringing you down

Rumor has it, ooh She is half your age
But I'm guessing that's the reason that you stayed
I heard you've been missing me
You've been telling people things that you shouldn't be
Like when we creep out and she ain't around
Haven't you heard the rumors Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
You made a fool out of me
And, boy, you're bringing me down
You made my heart melt, yet I'm cold to the core

I grow fonder every day
Lose myself in time
Just thinking of your face
God only knows why it's taken me
So long to let my doubts go
You're the only one that I want I don't know why I'm scared
I've been here before
Every feeling, every word
I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forget your past and simply be mine I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
I promise I'm worthy
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts If I've been on your mind
You hang on every word I say
Lose yourself in time
At the mention of my name
Will I ever know how it feels to hold you close
And have you tell me
Whichever road I choose, you'll go? I don't know why I'm scared
'Cause I've been here before
Every feeling, every word
I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forget your past and simply be mine I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
I promise I'm worthy, mm
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
Nobody's perfect
(I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
Trust me I've learned it
Nobody's perfect

To prove that I am the one who can, walk that mile
Until the end starts If you're not the one for me
Then I'll come back and bring you to your knees
If you're not the one for me
Why do I hate the idea of being free?
And if I'm not the one for you
You've gotta stop holding me the way you do
Oh when you found that the one for you
Why have we been through what we have been through It's so cold out here in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge What are you waiting for?
You never seem to make it through the door
And who are you hiding from?
It ain't no life to live like you're on the run
Have I ever asked for much?
The only thing that I want is your love If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge

I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so

Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge I've been walking in the same way as I did
Missing out the cracks in the pavement
And turning my heel and strutting my feet
"Is there anything I can do for you dear?
Is there anyone I could call?"
"No and thank you, please Madam.
I ain't lost, just wandering" Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Ooh the people I've met
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of now I like it in the city when the air is so thick and opaque
I love to see everybody in short skirts, shorts and shades
I like it in the city when two worlds collide
You get the people and the government
Everybody taking different sides Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united
Shows that we ain't gonna take it
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Ooh the people I've met yea Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of my world
Of my world, yeah
Of my world
Of my world, yeah Close enough to start a war
All that I have is on the floor
God only knows what we're fighting for
All that I say, you always say more I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe So I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't ask you, you to just desert me
I can't give you what you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables, to turning tables Under haunted skies I see
Where love is lost, your ghost is found
I've braved a hundred storms to leave you
As hard as you try, no, I will never be knocked down I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe So I won't let you close enough to hurt me, no
I won't ask you, you to just desert me
I can't give you what you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables, turning tables Next time I'll be braver, I'll be my own savior
When the thunder calls to me
Next time I'll be braver, I'll be my own savior
Standing on my own two feet I won't let you close enough to hurt me, no
I won't ask you, you to just desert me
I can't give you what you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables, to turning tables
Turning tables, yeah, turning This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the earth move and then
Hear my heart burst again For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall
At skyfall Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number, you can take my name
But you'll never have my heart Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me
Without the security
Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall Let the sky fall
We will stand tall
At skyfall Just the guitar This was all you, none of it me
You put your hands all over my body and told me, umm
You told me you were ready

We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more I only wanted to have fun
Learning to fly, learning to run
I let my heart decide the way
When I was young
Deep down I must have always known
That this would be inevitable
To earn my stripes I'd have to pay
And bear my soul I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who can't stand the reflection that they see
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago When I walk around all of the streets
Where I grew up and found my feet
They can't look me in the eye
It's like they're scared of me
I try to think of things to say
Like a joke or a memory
But they don't recognize me now
In the light of day I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who never became who they thought they'd be
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago
A million years ago Looking for some education
Made my way into the night
All that bullshit conversation
Baby, can't you read the signs? I won't bore you with the details, baby
I don't even wanna waste your time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help me ease my mind
I ain't Mr. Right But if you're looking for fast love
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
Had some bad love
So fast love is all that I've got on my mind Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh Looking for some affirmation
Made my way into the sun
My friends got their ladies
And they're all having babies
I just wanna have some fun I won't bore you with the details, baby
I don't even wanna waste your time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help me ease my mind
I ain't Mr. Right But if you're looking for fast love
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
I've had some bad love
So fast love is all that I've got on my mind Ooh, ooh
Baby, baby
Ooh, ooh
Baby, baby
Ooh, ooh
Baby, baby
Ooh In the absence of security
I made my way into the night
Stupid cupid keeps on calling me
And I see nothing in his eyes
I miss my baby
Oh I, I miss my baby
I miss my baby
I miss, I miss, I miss, I miss my baby
Ooh I, I miss my baby Take your eyes off of me so I can leave
I'm far too ashamed to do it with you watching me
This is never ending, we have been here before
But I can't stay this time 'cause I don't love you anymore
Please stay where you are
Don't come any closer
Don't try to change my mind
I'm being cruel to be kind I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me You have given me something that I can't live without
You mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt
But I don't want to carry on like everything is fine
The longer we ignore it all the more that we will fight
Please don't fall apart
I can't face your breaking heart
I'm trying to be brave
Stop asking me to stay I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me We're not the only ones
I don't regret a thing
Every word I've said
You know I'll always mean
It is the world to me
That you are in my life
But I want to live
And not just survive That's why I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
'Cause ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me
And I-I-I-I-I don't think you can save me I want every single piece of you
I want your heaven and your ocean's too
Treat me soft but touch me cool
I wanna teach you things you never knew, baby
Bring the floor up to my knees
Let me fall into your gravity
And kiss me back to life to see
Your body standing over me Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Down, down, down, down I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light I love the way your body moves
Towards me from across the room
Brushing past my every groove
No one has me like you do
In your heart I bring my soul
But be delicate with my ego
I wanna step into your great unknown
With you and me setting the tone Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Down, down, down, down I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light We play so dirty in the dark
'Cause we are living worlds apart
It only makes it harder baby
It only makes it harder baby (harder baby)
Harder baby (harder baby), harder baby I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you I remember all of the things that I thought I wanted to be
So desperate to find a way out of my world and finally breathe
Right before my eyes I saw, my heart it came to life
This ain't easy it's not meant to be
Every story has its scars When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
That I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
That I will be, I will be your remedy No river is too wide or too deep for me to swim to you
Come whenever I'll be the shelter that won't let the rain come through
Your love, it is my truth
And I will always love you
Love you When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
That I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
That I will be, I will be your remedy, oh When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
I will be, I will be
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
That I will be, I will be, I will be
Your remedy, oh Didn't I give it all?
Tried my best
Gave you everything I had, everything and no less
Didn't I do it right? Did I let you down?
Maybe you got too used to having me 'round
Still how can you walk away
From all my tears
It's gonna be an empty road without me right here
But go on and take it, take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love, take it all with my love Maybe I should leave, to help you see
Nothing is better than this and this is everything we need
So is it over? Is this really it, you're giving up so easily
I thought you loved me more than this But go on, go on, take it, take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love, take it all with my love I will change if I must
Slow it down and bring it home, I will adjust
Oh if only, if only you knew
Everything I do, is for you But go on and take it, take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it, take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all, with my love
Take it all with my love
Take it all with my love This is how the story went
I met someone by accident
It blew me away
Blew me away It was in the darkest of my days
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
And buried them away, you buried them away I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away Dropped you off at the train station
Put a kiss on top of your head
Watch you wave
And watched you wave Then I went on home to my skyscrapers
And neon lights and waiting papers
That I call home
I call that home I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away, away Woke up feeling heavy-hearted
I'm going back to where I started
The morning rain, the morning rain
And though I wish that you were here
On that same old road that brought me here
It's calling me home, It's calling me home I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away
I can't spend my whole life hiding my heart away I don't want you to be no slave
I don't want you to work all day
But I want you to be true
And I just want to make love to you
Love to you, ooh baby

But you won't
No, you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me
When you don't
When you don't, yeah I'll close my eyes
'Cause then I don't see

Say that you love me in your last goodbye
Please forgive me, for my sins
Yes, I swam dirty waters
But you pushed me in
I've seen your face, under every sky
Over every border and on every line
You know my heart, more than I do
We were the greatest, me and you But we had time against us
And miles between us
The heavens cried
I know I left you speechless
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue
And I see my future in you I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll do everything different
I'll be better to you,
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll be somebody different
I'll be better to you Let me stay here for just one more night
Build your world around me
And pull me to the light
So I can tell you that I was wrong
I was a child then, but now I'm willing to learn But we had time against us
And miles between us
The heavens cried
I know I left you speechless
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue
And I see my future in you I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll do everything different
I'll be better to you

Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me with out the security
Of your loving arms keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand.... Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
At sky fall Let the sky fall
We will stand tall
At skyfall (Verse 1)
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go head and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark Chorus 1
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling, we could've had it all... (You're gonna wish you never met me)
Rolling in the deep... (Tears are gonna fall rollin' in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never met me)
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall rollin' in the deep) Verse 2
Baby I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Making a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared (Chorus 2)
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling, we could've had it all
Rolling in the deep... you had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it to the beat
Could've had it all... Rollin' in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating (Verse 3)
Throw your stone through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow (Chorus 3)
We could've had it all... We could've had it all...
It all, It all, It all... We could've had it all...
Rollin' in the deep...
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it to the beat
Could've had it all
Rollin' in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it, you played it, you played it, you played it to the beat Some say, I'll be better without you,
They don't know you like I do,
Or at least as far as I thought I knew
I can't bear this time,
It drags, as I lose my mind
Reminded by things I find
I know some clothes you left behind.
Wake me up, wake me up when all is done
I won't rise until this battle's won
My dignity is become undone But I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go, I can't do it on my own,
If this is ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk So petrified, I'm so scared to step into this right,
What if I lose my heart and fail the ?
I won't forgive me if I gave up trying
I heard his voice today
I didn't know a single word he said
Now I'm resemblance to the man I met
Just a vague and broken boy instead But I won't go, I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go, I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk There will be times, we'll try and give it up
Bursting at the seams, no doubt
We almost fall apart and burn up easy
So watch them turn to dust
But nothing will never taint us I won't go, I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go, I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk Will he, will he still remember me?
Will he still love me even when he's free
Or will he go back to the place where
He will choose the poison over me?
When we spoke yesterday
He said to hold my breath, to sit and wait
I'll be home soon, I won't be late He won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
He's willing to take the risk
So I won't go, I can't do it on his own,
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk 'Cause he won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
We're willing to take the risk
I won't go! I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk I let it fall, my heart,
And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands, they're strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,
Your name When I lay with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together nothing gets better 'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name,
Your name I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Well, it felt something died
'Cause I knew that that was
The last time, the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door,
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,
Your name I set fire to the rain,
And I threw us into the flames
Well, it felt something died
'Cause I knew that, that was the last time
The last time Let it burn
Let it burn
Let it burn Daydreamer
Sitting on the sea
Soaking up the sun
He is a real lover
And making up the past
Feeling up his girl
Like he's never felt a figure before A jaw dropper
Looks good when he walks
Is the subject of their talk
He would be hard to chase
But good to catch
And he could change the world
With his hands behind his back, oh You can find him sittin' on your doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And you can tell that he'll be there for life Daydreamer
With eyes that make you melt
He lends his coat for shelter
Plus he's there for you
When he shouldn't be
But he stays all the same
Waits for you
Then sees you through There's no way I
Could describe him
What I'll say is
Just what I'm hoping for But I will find him sittin' on my doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And I can tell that he'll be there for life
And I can tell that he'll be there for life With your loving, there ain't nothing
That I can't adore
The way I'm running, with you, honey
Is we can break every low
I find it funny that you're the only
One I never looked for
There is something in your loving
That tears down my walls I wasn't ready then, I'm ready now
I'm heading straight for you
You will only be eternally
The one that I belong to The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I've known I'll forever be whatever you want me to be
I'll go under and all over for your clarity
When you wonder if I'm gonna lose my way home
Just remember, that come whatever, I'll be yours all alone I wasn't ready then, I'm ready now
I'm heading straight for you
You will only be eternally
The one that I belong to The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I've known I've been looking for you, baby
In every face that I've ever known
And there is something 'bout the way you love me
That finally feels like home
All my life, you're my darkness
You're the right kind of madness
And you're my hope, you're my despair
You're my scope, everything, everywhere The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I've known Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Devotion [Verse 1]
When did it go wrong, I will never know
I have loved you all my life
How did it slow down, I go round and round
Thinking about it all the time [Pre-Chorus]
I gave you heaven on a platter baby
I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me
This love, it ain't over yet
There's too much that I haven't said [Chorus]
Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write, had a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go [Verse 2]
Why were you so cold, let the truth be told
Tell me was it all for the thrill?
What was I thinking, I gave you everything
But you still went for the kill [Pre-Chorus]
I gave you heaven on a platter baby
I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me [Chorus]
Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write, had a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go [Bridge]
Oooh sometimes I feel like I'm in the dark
Oooh I thought I'd die in your arms [Chorus]
Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write, I had a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go [Outro]
Hope you know, I won't let go I thought I told you, he'd be home soon
Couldn't help myself, you're too good to be true.
I fall short each time,
Every time he ain't here
You and your charm creep closer
Closer and near
Like a fool for fire, I fall, with my pride and all.
Like a bomb before explosion,
Ticking by your call,
You're the wiser one, disguised from greed,
And I'm just a child who belongs on her knees. But I found a boy who I love more,
Than I ever did you before,
So stand beside the river I cried,
And lay yourself down.
Look how you want me now that I don't need you. So, you thought that I'd crumble to my knees
At the first sight of you crawling back to me
To whisper "will you leave your man? "
Cause you swear that this time you can stand by me.
I won't stand by you. Cause I found a boy who I love more,
Than I ever did you before,
So stand beside the river I cried
And lay yourself down.
Look how you want me now that I don't need you! I ain't yours for no taking,
You must be mistaken
I could never look into your eyes, and settle for wrong
And ignore the right When I found a boy who loves me more,
Than you ever did me before.
So stand beside the river you cried
And lay yourself down!
Look how you want me now that I don't need you! Found myself today singing out your name,
You said I'm crazy,
If I am I'm crazy for you. Sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here
Turns me crazy,
But it's you who makes me lose my head. And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head
And turn me into a crumbling fool. Tell me to run and I'll race,
If you want me to stop I'll freeze,
And if you want me gone. I'll leave, just hold me closer baby,
And make me crazy for you.
Crazy for you. Lately with this state I'm in I can't help myself but spin.
I wish you'd come over,
Send me spinning closer to you. My oh my, how my blood boils, it's sweet taste for you,
Strips me down bare
And gets me into my favorite mood. I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away,
But the more I do,
The crazier I turn into. Pacing floors and opening doors,
Hoping you'll walk through
And save me boy,
Because I'm too crazy for you.
Crazy for you Everybody tells me it's 'bout time that I moved on
And I need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young
But my heart is a valley, it's so shallow and man made
I'm scared to death if I let you in that you'll see I'm just a fake
Sometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch
But I know that's just me, 'cause nothing ever is enough
When I was a child I grew up by the River Lea
There was something in the water, now that something's in me
Oh I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river But it's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain But it's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea I should probably tell you now before it's way too late
That I never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face
Consider this my apology, I know it's years in advance
But I'd rather say it now in case I never get the chance
No, I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river But it's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain It's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea I never woulda hitch-hiked to Birmingham
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda caught the train to Louisiana
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda run through the blindin' rain
Without one dollar to my name
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love I never woulda seen the trouble that I'm in
If it hadn't been for love
Woulda been gone like a wayward wind
If it hadn't been for love
Nobody knows it better than me
I wouldn't be wishing I was free
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love Four cold walls against my will
At least I know he's lying still
Four cold walls without parole
Lord have mercy on my soul Four cold walls against my will
At least I know he's lying still
Four cold walls without parole
Lord have mercy on my soul I never woulda hitch-hiked to Birmingham
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda caught the train to Louisiana
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda loaded up a forty-four
Put myself behind a jailhouse door
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love, yes
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love, yes Hold my hand while you cut me down
It had only just begun but now it's over now
And you're in the heat of moments with your heart playing up cold
I'm between the middle watching hastiness unfold
On my eyes you were smiling in the spotlight dancing with the night
The night
When I fell off your mind I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Oy, I'm tired Where'd you go when you stayed behind
I looked up and inside down and outside only to find
A double taking punching hard and laughing at my smile
I get closer you obviously prefer her I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Oy, I'm tired (I should have known) Never mind said your open arms
I couldn't help believe they tricked me back into them, even though I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Oy, I'm tired Who wants to be right as rain
It's better when something is wrong
You get excitement in your bones
And everything you do's a game
When night comes and you're on your own
You can say I chose to be alone
Who wants to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top 'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love Who wants to be riding high
When you'll just crumble back on down
You give up everything you are
And even then you don't get far
They make believe that everything
Is exactly what it seems
But at least when you're at your worst
You know how to feel things 'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love Go ahead and still my heart
To make me cry again
'Cause it will never hurt
As much as it did then
We were both right
And no one had blame
But now I give up
On this endless game 'Cause who wants to be right as rain
It's better when something is wrong
I get excitement in my bones
Even though everything's a strain
When night comes and I'm on my own
You should know I chose to be alone
Who wants to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top 'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love No room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love So little to say but so much time
Despite my empty mouth the words are in my mind
Please wear the face, the one where you smile
Because you lighten up my heart when I start to cry Forgive me first love, but I'm tired
I need to get away to feel again
Try to understand why, don't get so close to change my mind
Please wipe that look out of your eyes, it's bribing me to doubt myself
Simply, it's tiring This love has dried up and stayed behind
And if I stay I'll be alive
Then choke on words I'd always hide
Excuse me first love, but we're through
I need to taste the kiss from someone new Forgive me first love, but I'm too tired
I'm bored to say the least and I, I lack desire
Forgive me first love, forgive me first love, forgive me first love
Forgive me first love forgive me, forgive me first love, forgive me first love This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the earth move and then
Hear my heart burst again For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen Let the skyfall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together Let the skyfall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall
At skyfall Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number, you can take my name
But you'll never have my heart Let the skyfall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together Let the skyfall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together
At skyfall [x2:]
(Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall) Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me
Without the security
Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand Let the skyfall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together Let the skyfall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together
At skyfall Let the sky fall
We will stand tall
At skyfall This is how the story went
I met someone by accident
It blew me away
Blew me away It was in the darkest of my days
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
And buried them away, you buried them away I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away Dropped you off at the train station
Put a kiss on top of your head
Watch you wave
And watched you wave Then I went on home to my skyscrapers
And neon lights and waiting papers
That I call home
I call that home I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away, away Woke up feeling heavy-hearted
I'm going back to where I started
The morning rain, the morning rain
And though I wish that you were here
On that same old road that brought me here
It's calling me home, It's calling me home I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away
I can't spend my whole life hiding my heart away Right under my feet there's air made of bricks
Pulls me down turns me weak for you
I find myself repeating like a broken tune
And I'm forever excusing your intentions
That I give in to my pretendings
Which forgive you each time
Without me knowing
They melt my heart to stone And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love Each and every time I turn around to leave
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
So desperately I try to link it with my head
But instead I fall back to my knees
As you tear your way right through me
I forgive you once again
Without me knowing
You've burnt my heart to stone And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love Why do you steal my hand
Whenever I'm standing my own ground
You build me up, then leave me dead I hear your words you made up
I say your name like there should be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one, in love
I'm the only one in love Fool that I am for falling in love with you
And fool that I am for thinking you loved me too You took my heart then played the part of little coquette
And my dreams just disappeared like the smoke from a cigarette Fool that I am for hoping you'd understand
And thinking you would listen to all of the things
The things I had planned But we couldn't see eye to eye
So darling
Darling
Darling this is goodbye Oh
I still care
Fool that I am
Ooh
I still care
Fool that I am You say it's all in my head
And the things I think just don't make sense
So where you been then? Don't go all coy
Don't turn it round on me like it's my fault
See I can see that look in your eyes
The one that shoots me each and every time You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her These days when I see you
You make it look like I'm see-through
Do tell me why you waste our time
When your heart ain't in it, and you're not satisfied
You know I know just how you feel
I'm starting to find myself feeling that way too When you grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her Time and time again, I play the role of fool
(Just for you)
Even in the daylight when you think that
(I don't see you)
Try to look for things I hear but our eyes never find
Though I do know how you play You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her [Adele]
Why do you love me
Do you love me...?
Why do you love me
Do you love me?
Why do you love me
Do you love me? Why do you love me...? Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me? Why do you love me?
There must be something in the water
Cause baby I'm in deeper than I knew
How do you keep me coming back for more
After all we've been through
I can't decide if I should run and hide It's above and beyond me
It's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy
It's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me... Who knows why I love you
It could be something in the air I breath
Whatever it is, I depend on it
Where does the time go?
I spend every single moment daydreaming of you
I can't describe how I feel, it feels right It's above and beyond me
It's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy
It's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me You were a shock in the dark that blew me away
And you left your mark and it never will fade
You ignited a spark, let the fires away
Are you ready, ready?
You have a place in my heart that will always be yours
You are the peak and art of my universe
Every piece and part, you were the first
I am ready, ready It's above and beyond me,
It's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you It's above and beyond me,
It's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me... Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me? You said I'm stubborn and I never give in
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that
I think you're giving out in way too much in fact
I say we've only known each other a year
You say I've known you longer my dear
You like to be so close, I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
Walking with each other,
Think we'll never match at all, but we do
But we do, but we do, but we do I thought I knew myself, somehow you know me more
I've never known this, never before
You're the first to make up whenever we argue
I don't know who I'd be if I didn't know you
You're so provocative, I'm so conservative
You're so adventurous, I'm so very cautious, combining
You think we would and we do,
But we do, but we do, but we do Favoritism ain't my thing but,
In this situation I'll be glad Favoritism ain't my thing but,
In this situation I'll be glad to make an exception You said I'm stubborn and I never give in
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that
I think you're giving out in way too much in fact
I say we've only known each other one year
You say I've known you longer my dear
You like to be so close, I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
Walking with each other,
Think we'll never match at all, but we do In the darkness of my heart is a shadow of your face
From the deepest part of my regret
I hear the words I wish I'd said
At the dawning of the day
I can't wait to see the light
Make up memories in my head
They help to fill the emptiness you've left
I can't drown in your tears
I won't face your fears
I need to fight my own
You'll never see me again oh baby in time
Let the weight take me under
I know I'll survive
You'll never see me again At the dawning of the day
I can't bare to see the light
Make up memories in my head
They help to fill the emptiness you've left
I can't drown in your tears
I won't face your fears
I need to fight my own
You'll never see me again oh baby in time
Let the weight take me under
I know I'll survive Let the floor beneath of me fall
Let the sky come crashing down
Turn all my right to wrong
But after you that goes on
You'll never see me again
I've been learning to live without you
It's taken all of my stake
But I'm stronger now You'll never see me again oh baby in time
Let the weight take me under
I know I'll survive Let the floor beneath of me fall
Let the sky come crashing down
Turn all my right to wrong
But after you that goes on
You'll never see me again
You'll never see me again
You'll never see me again I want to see your face in every kind of light
In fields of dawn and forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make What are you doing the rest of your life?
North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me I want to see your face in every kind of light
In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes
In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes
It may take a kiss or two Through all of my life
Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall of my life
All I ever will recall of my life
Is all of my life with you Wait, do you see my heart on my sleeve?
It's been there for days on end and
It's been waiting for you to open up
Yours too baby, come on now
I'm trying to tell you just how
I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally
Say that it's always been me That's made you feel the way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last
Like I'm the one for you You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me
Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me Why is it every time I think I've tried my hardest
It turns out it ain't enough
You're still not mentioning love
What am I supposed to do to make you want me properly?
I'm taking these chances and getting nowhere
And though I'm trying my hardest you go back to her
And I think that I know things may never change
I'm still hoping one day I might hear you say I make you feel the way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last
Like I'm the one for you You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me
Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me But, despite the truth that I know
I find it hard to let go and give up on you
Seems I love the things you do
Like the meaner you treat me the more eager I am
To persist with this heartbreak and running around
And I will do until I'm finding myself you And make you feel a way you've never felt before
And be all you need so that you never want more
And you'll say all of the right things without a clue
And you'll be the one for me and me the one for you I let it fall, my heart,
And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands, they're strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,
Your name When I lay with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together nothing gets better 'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name,
Your name I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Well, it felt something died
'Cause I knew that that was
The last time, the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door,
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,
Your name I set fire to the rain,
And I threw us into the flames
Well, it felt something died
'Cause I knew that, that was the last time
The last time Let it burn
Let it burn
Let it burn [Adele]
I would never lie to you unless you tell me to...
Every part of me
All my words to hold
And hold against me
Why won't you let it be? Don't you ever say my love opened up your heart
No I'm not gonna do it standing up
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby
Won't you turn off the lights Lay me down
'til the morning!
Lay me down (through the night)
Lay me down (I can fall in)
Lay me down (Won't you)
Lay me down (I can baby)
Lay me down (Someone believe me) I would never break the rules unless you tell me to
You can read my mind, be it truth or lies
Lie down beside me, why won't you let it be? Don't you ever say my love opened up your heart
No I'm not gonna do it standing up
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights Lay me down ('til the morning)
Lay me down (through the night)
Lay me down (I can fall in)
Lay me down (Won't you)
Lay me down (I can baby)
Lay me down (Someone believe me) Lay down with me
Lay down with me
Lay down with me
Lay down with me Words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights Lay me down ('til the morning)
Lay me down (through the night)
Lay me down (I can fall in)
Lay me down (Won't you)
Lay me down (I can baby)
Lay me down
Someone believe me Never been a girl who used to cry
Didn`t show emotions, don`t know why
Didn`t wanna feel the pain inside, I guess But as the years keep going by,
you came along and changed my mind
I should leave the past behind me,
I should let you find me,
supposed to stay beside me
You were supposed to guide me,
through the ups and downs,
you were always gonna be around until the end I still think we could
`cause you and me, we`re good
And I`ll tell you why this hurts, 'cause I`m sober But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has put me through
Even when I've had too much,
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough So I pour myself another drink
whenever I start to think about you
`cause I do but I really don`t want to
but sometimes my dreams just come through And when I get there,
to a place where I see you in a kitchen
I start wishing for that thing and I don`t need you,
I don`t really wanna see you
and I don`t want you to see me,
you would think that I was crazy,
you might think that I wanna be close to you
but I`d rather wanna drink some Whisky
and maybe have a little sip `o wine
`cause right now it`s the only thing that makes me forget you were mine
but right now I am sober But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has put me through
Even when I've had too much,
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough I still think we could
(I`m not drunk enough)
`cause you and me, we`re good
`cause I`m sober But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has put me through
Even when I've had too much,
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough (I still think we could)
But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has put me through
(`cause you and me we`re good)
Even when I've had too much,
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough Think I've had enough
I must my way
I've fallen off the edge to find that I've gone blind
You're leading me astray
You haunt me like a ghost
And that scares me the most
There you are the devil on my shoulder
Smiling as the flames are growing colder
How can I believer what I have?
For a little confidence I'll grab But when my hand goes out don't take it for I'm trying to make it on my own
I fell it in my bones any minute now!
This train of thought will leave the statio
My impatience will come out to play
You've turned out to be the only face I see!
Running through the empty hallways I can tell that I am not alone You spin a web in every room
You spin a web in every room
And try to break the backbone that I've grown
Will I make my own path or wander where I'm thrown
Will I make my own path or wander where I'm thrown
Or wander where I'm thrown? When we used
To say goodnight
I'd always kiss
And hold you tight
But lately
You don't seem
To care
You close the door
And leave me
Standing there
Oh, honey
That's not fair
That's it
I quit
I'm movin' on The other night
We had a date
An you showed up
Two hours late
And though your hair
Was all in place
Somebody smeared
Their lipstick
On your face
Oh, they smeared it
Every place
Ye that's it honey
I quit I'm movin' on [Chorus]
You made me want you
You made me leave you
You made me tumble
And fall
But if I
Can't have you the way
I want you
I don't want you at all Baby, I can take a lot
'Cause I love
Everything you got
Though your kisses
Fill me
So if you got
Someone else
I gotta go
Oh, that you know
Ye that's it honey
I quit I'm movin' on [Chorus] Baby
I can take a lot
'Cause I love
Everything you got
Though your kisses
Fill me
So if you got
Someone else
I gotta go
Oh, that you know
So that's it baby
I quit I'm movin' on
Ye that's it baby
I quit now
I'm movin' on Don't ask me
What you know is true
Don't have to tell you
I love your precious heart I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never tear us apart We could live
For a thousand years
But if I hurt you
I'd make wine from your tears I told you
That we could fly
'Cause we all have wings
But some of us don't know why I
I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never ever tear us apart I know sometimes you're scared of the light
But how will you ever know if you never try
There's something new inside my heart
And it grabs like a child whenever we're apart
I see your face under every sky
I find the less I look, more I find
So let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want You know sometimes that I'm scared of the dark
But I'm feeling sun babe when I'm in your arms
You said my name in the dead of glory
You hold me alright
When I'm short of falling So let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want There will be times
When we'll try to give it up
Bursting out, it seems no doubt that will almost fall apart than burn to pieces
And we'll watch them turn to dust
But without each other, nothing is easy enough So let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
'cause you're the only one I want, yeah
You're the only one
Never gonna leave you
No, I'm never gonna leave you, no Go ahead, go ahead and smash it on the floor
Take whatever is left, and take it with you out the door
See if I cry
See if I shed a single sorry tear
Can't say that it's been that great
No in fact it's been a wasted worried year [Chorus]
Everybody sees
And everyone agrees
That you and I are wrong
And it's been that way to long
Take it as it comes
And be thankful when it's done
There's so many ways to act
And there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black Let it out, let it all out
Say what's on your mind
You can kick and scream and shout and say things that are so unkind
Yeah-see if I care, see if I stand firm or if I fall
Cause in the back of my mind, and on the tip of my tongue
Is the answer to it all [Chorus] Yeah there's many shades of black [Chorus] Cause there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
Yeah there's any shades of black
There's so many shades of black
Yeah there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
And there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black Go ahead... Last night she said
Oh, baby
I feel so down
Oh, and turned me off
When I feel left out
So I
I turned around
Oh, baby
I don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking
Out that door Well, I've been in town
For just about fifteen
Whole minutes now
Oh, baby, I feel so down
And I don't know why
I keep walking for miles But the people
They don't understand
No, girlfriends
They can't understand
Your grandsons
They won't understand
On top of this
I ain't ever
Gonna understand Last night she said
Oh, baby
Don't feel so down
Oh, and turned me off
When I feel left out
So I, I turned around
Oh, baby
I'm gonna be alright
It was a great big lie
Cuz I left that night
Yeah Oh, people
They don't understand
No, girlfriends
They don't understand
In spaceships
They won't understand
And me
I ain't ever
Gonna understand Last night she said
Oh, baby
I feel so down
She had turned me off
When I feel left out
So I
I turned around
Oh, little girl
I don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking
Out that door, yeah Painting pictures with my mind
Making memories using my eyes
Filling up my heart with golden stories
Who adds some spice to the rhythm of life, oh Welcome sunrise with the morning glory
I've changed my mind
There is no simple
I thought of me, I want to see
I want to feel my heartbeat so
With the world that you feel, leave I can feel the pressure pushing onto my heart
And it's teasing me
To scratch my itch and beat my drum
So I can start to begin what's begun Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories Running riots inside my soul
Fire burning and it's lighting me up
To scratch my itch and beat my drum
So I can finish what has begun Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories Sometimes the hole you left hurts
My heart so bad, it cuts through
The deepest parts of me and fills up my mouth with the words that cry
Out, I'm still trying to stay inside Hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts Our hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts Every now and then my memories ache
With empty ideas of the ones we'd have made it
But as time goes on and my age gets older
I love the ones I know, they're enough to picture the rest 'Cause heart break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts Our hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts You know when to make me, imagine you're here
You know when to make me, imagine you're here
You know when to make me, imagine you're here
You know when to make me, imagine you're here Find yourself a girl

That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me, it isn't over Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me, it isn't over Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste? Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
[Clean version:] Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
[Explicit version:] Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare
See how I leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch
And it's bringing me out the dark The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it, to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you
And I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there
As mine sure won't be shared (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love remind me of us
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
I can't help feeling
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it, to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it, with a beating Throw your soul through every open door (woah)
Count your blessings to find what you look for (woah)
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (woah)
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow (woah)
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could have had it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
It all, it all, it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me) But you played it
You played it
You played it
You played it to the beat. Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet There's such a difference between us
And a million miles Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly
Doesn't tear you apart anymore Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened? It's no secret
That the both of us
Are running out of time So hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly
Doesn't tear you apart anymore Oh, anymore
Oh, anymore
Oh, anymore
Anymore Hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly
Doesn't tear you apart anymore I will leave my heart at the door
I won't say a word
They've all been said before you know
So why don't we just play pretend
Like we're not scared of what's coming next
Or scared of having nothing left Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again? I don't need your honesty
It's already in your eyes
And I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that matters
Tell me who do I run to? Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again? Let this be our lesson in love
Let this be the way we remember us
I don't wanna be cruel or vicious
And I ain't asking for forgiveness
All I ask is If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again? I let it fall, my heart,
And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands, they're strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cry
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name When laying with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here, forever
You and me together, nothing gets better Cause there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Where I felt something die, 'cause I knew that
That was the last time, the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door
As if that heart you caught is still waiting for you
Even now when it's already over
I can't help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Where I felt something die
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time, oh
Oh, oh Let it burn, oh
Let it burn
Let it burn Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk
To the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home
You're like a dream come true
But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment
Before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song I was so scared to face my fears
Nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swore you moved overseas
That's what you said, when you left me You still look like a movie
You still sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young It's hard to win me back
Everything just takes me back
To when you were there
To when you were there
And a part of me keeps holding on
Just in case it hasn't gone
I guess I still care
Do you still care? It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old
It makes me reckless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
When we were young Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am home again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am whole again Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am young again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am fun again However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I will always love you Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am free again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am clean again However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I will always love you However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
'Cause I love you When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
no doubt in my mind were you belong I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the Earth for you
To make you feel my love To make you feel my love I've made up my mind
Don't need to think it over
If I'm wrong I am right
Don't need to look no further
This ain't lust
I know this is love but If I tell the world
I'll never say enough
Cause it was not said to you
And that's exactly what I need to do
If I'm in love with you Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste?
Even If I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere I'd build myself up
And fly around in circles
Waiting as my heart drops
And my back begins to tingle
Finally could this be it or Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste?
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere yeah Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if, it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste?
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up,
Or should I just keep on chasing pavements?
Should I just keep on chasing pavements? Or Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste?
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere When will I see you again?
You left with no goodbye, not a single word was said
No final kiss to seal anything
I had no idea of the state we were in I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head
But don't you remember, don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before,
Baby please remember me once more When was the last time you thought of me?
Or have you completely erased me from your memories?
I often think about where I went wrong
The more I do, the less I know But I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head
But don't you remember, don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby please remember me once more Oh, I gave you the space so you could breathe
I kept my distance so you would be free
In hope that you find the missing piece
To bring you back to me Why don't you remember, don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby please remember me once more
When will I see you again? She, she ain't real
She ain't gonna be able to love you like I will
She is a stranger
You and I have history
Or don't you remember
Sure, she's got it all
But, baby, is that really what you want Bless your soul, you've got you're head in the clouds
You made a fool out of you
And, boy, she's bringing you down
She made your heart melt
But you're cold to the core
Now rumor has it she ain't got your love anymore Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh She is half your age
But I'm guessing that's the reason that you stayed
I heard you've been missing me
You've been telling people things that you shouldn't be
Like when we creep out and she ain't around
Haven't you heard the rumors Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
You made a fool out of me
And, boy, you're bringing me down
You made my heart melt, yet I'm cold to the core
But rumor has it I'm the one you're leaving her for Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh

Tell a story that I cannot bear to hear
Just 'cause I said it, it don't mean that I meant it
People say crazy things
Just 'cause I said it, don't mean that I meant it
Just 'cause you heard it Rumor has it, ooh,

I grow fonder every day
Lose myself in time
Just thinking of your face
God only knows why it's taken me
So long to let my doubts go
You're the only one that I want I don't know why I'm scared
I've been here before
Every feeling, every word
I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forget your past and simply be mine I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
I promise I'm worthy
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts If I've been on your mind
You hang on every word I say
Lose yourself in time
At the mention of my name
Will I ever know how it feels to hold you close
And have you tell me
Whichever road I choose, you'll go? I don't know why I'm scared
'Cause I've been here before
Every feeling, every word
I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forget your past and simply be mine I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
I promise I'm worthy, mm
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
Nobody's perfect
(I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
Trust me I've learned it
Nobody's perfect
(I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
Trust me I've learned it
Nobody's perfect

I promise I'm worthy
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove that I am the, one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts Come on and give me the chance
To prove that I am the one who can, walk that mile
Until the end starts If you're not the one for me
Then I'll come back and bring you to your knees
If you're not the one for me
Why do I hate the idea of being free?
And if I'm not the one for you
You've gotta stop holding me the way you do
Oh when you found that the one for you
Why have we been through what we have been through It's so cold out here in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge What are you waiting for?
You never seem to make it through the door
And who are you hiding from?
It ain't no life to live like you're on the run
Have I ever asked for much?
The only thing that I want is your love If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge It's so cold in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge I've been walking in the same way as I did
Missing out the cracks in the pavement
And turning my heel and strutting my feet
"Is there anything I can do for you dear?
Is there anyone I could call?"
"No and thank you, please Madam.
I ain't lost, just wandering" Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Ooh the people I've met
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of now I like it in the city when the air is so thick and opaque
I love to see everybody in short skirts, shorts and shades
I like it in the city when two worlds collide
You get the people and the government
Everybody taking different sides Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united
Shows that we ain't gonna take it
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Ooh the people I've met yea Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of my world
Of my world, yeah
Of my world
Of my world, yeah Close enough to start a war
All that I have is on the floor
God only knows what we're fighting for
All that I say, you always say more I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe So I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't ask you, you to just desert me
I can't give you what you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables, to turning tables Under haunted skies I see
Where love is lost, your ghost is found
I've braved a hundred storms to leave you
As hard as you try, no, I will never be knocked down I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe So I won't let you close enough to hurt me, no
I won't ask you, you to just desert me
I can't give you what you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables, turning tables Next time I'll be braver, I'll be my own savior
When the thunder calls to me
Next time I'll be braver, I'll be my own savior
Standing on my own two feet I won't let you close enough to hurt me, no
I won't ask you, you to just desert me
I can't give you what you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables, to turning tables
Turning tables, yeah, turning This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the earth move and then
Hear my heart burst again For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall
At skyfall Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number, you can take my name
But you'll never have my heart Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me
Without the security
Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall Let the sky fall
We will stand tall
At skyfall Just the guitar This was all you, none of it me
You put your hands all over my body and told me, umm
You told me you were ready
For the big one, for the big jump
I'd be your last love everlasting you and me
That was what you told me I'm giving you up

We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more I only wanted to have fun
Learning to fly, learning to run
I let my heart decide the way
When I was young
Deep down I must have always known
That this would be inevitable
To earn my stripes I'd have to pay
And bear my soul I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who can't stand the reflection that they see
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago When I walk around all of the streets
Where I grew up and found my feet
They can't look me in the eye
It's like they're scared of me
I try to think of things to say
Like a joke or a memory
But they don't recognize me now
In the light of day I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who never became who they thought they'd be
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago
A million years ago Looking for some education
Made my way into the night
All that bullshit conversation
Baby, can't you read the signs? I won't bore you with the details, baby
I don't even wanna waste your time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help me ease my mind
I ain't Mr. Right But if you're looking for fast love
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
Had some bad love
So fast love is all that I've got on my mind Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh Looking for some affirmation
Made my way into the sun
My friends got their ladies
And they're all having babies
I just wanna have some fun I won't bore you with the details, baby
I don't even wanna waste your time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help me ease my mind
I ain't Mr. Right But if you're looking for fast love
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
I've had some bad love
So fast love is all that I've got on my mind Ooh, ooh
Baby, baby
Ooh, ooh
Baby, baby
Ooh, ooh
Baby, baby
Ooh In the absence of security
I made my way into the night
Stupid cupid keeps on calling me
And I see nothing in his eyes
I miss my baby
Oh I, I miss my baby
I miss my baby
I miss, I miss, I miss, I miss my baby
Ooh I, I miss my baby Take your eyes off of me so I can leave
I'm far too ashamed to do it with you watching me
This is never ending, we have been here before
But I can't stay this time 'cause I don't love you anymore
Please stay where you are
Don't come any closer
Don't try to change my mind
I'm being cruel to be kind I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me You have given me something that I can't live without
You mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt
But I don't want to carry on like everything is fine
The longer we ignore it all the more that we will fight
Please don't fall apart
I can't face your breaking heart
I'm trying to be brave
Stop asking me to stay I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me We're not the only ones
I don't regret a thing
Every word I've said
You know I'll always mean
It is the world to me
That you are in my life
But I want to live
And not just survive That's why I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
'Cause ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me
And I-I-I-I-I don't think you can save me I want every single piece of you
I want your heaven and your ocean's too
Treat me soft but touch me cool
I wanna teach you things you never knew, baby
Bring the floor up to my knees
Let me fall into your gravity
And kiss me back to life to see
Your body standing over me Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Down, down, down, down I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light I love the way your body moves
Towards me from across the room
Brushing past my every groove
No one has me like you do
In your heart I bring my soul
But be delicate with my ego
I wanna step into your great unknown
With you and me setting the tone Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Down, down, down, down I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light We play so dirty in the dark
'Cause we are living worlds apart
It only makes it harder baby
It only makes it harder baby (harder baby)
Harder baby (harder baby), harder baby I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you I remember all of the things that I thought I wanted to be
So desperate to find a way out of my world and finally breathe
Right before my eyes I saw, my heart it came to life
This ain't easy it's not meant to be
Every story has its scars When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
That I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
That I will be, I will be your remedy No river is too wide or too deep for me to swim to you
Come whenever I'll be the shelter that won't let the rain come through
Your love, it is my truth
And I will always love you
Love you When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
That I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
That I will be, I will be your remedy, oh When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
I will be, I will be
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
That I will be, I will be, I will be
Your remedy, oh Didn't I give it all?
Tried my best
Gave you everything I had, everything and no less
Didn't I do it right? Did I let you down?
Maybe you got too used to having me 'round
Still how can you walk away
From all my tears
It's gonna be an empty road without me right here
But go on and take it, take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love, take it all with my love Maybe I should leave, to help you see
Nothing is better than this and this is everything we need
So is it over? Is this really it, you're giving up so easily
I thought you loved me more than this But go on, go on, take it, take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love, take it all with my love I will change if I must
Slow it down and bring it home, I will adjust
Oh if only, if only you knew
Everything I do, is for you But go on and take it, take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it, take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all, with my love
Take it all with my love
Take it all with my love This is how the story went
I met someone by accident
It blew me away
Blew me away It was in the darkest of my days
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
And buried them away, you buried them away I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away Dropped you off at the train station
Put a kiss on top of your head
Watch you wave
And watched you wave Then I went on home to my skyscrapers
And neon lights and waiting papers
That I call home
I call that home I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away, away Woke up feeling heavy-hearted
I'm going back to where I started
The morning rain, the morning rain
And though I wish that you were here
On that same old road that brought me here
It's calling me home, It's calling me home I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away
I can't spend my whole life hiding my heart away I don't want you to be no slave
I don't want you to work all day
But I want you to be true
And I just want to make love to you
Love to you, ooh baby
Love to you, yeah All I want to do is wash your clothes
I don't want to keep you indoors
There is nothing you can't do
But keep me making love to me

And I can hear by the way you talk that talk

Turn down the bed
Turn down these voices
Inside my head Lay down with me
And tell me no lies
Just hold me closly
Don't patronize Don't patronize me 'Cause I can't make you love me
If you don't
You can't make your heart feel
Something that it won't
And even in the dark
These final hours
I will lay down my heart
I will feel the power
But you won't
No, you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me
When you don't
When you don't, yeah I'll close my eyes
'Cause then I don't see
The love you don't feel
When you're holding me Morning will come
And I'll do what's right
Just give me till then
To give up this fight And I will give up this fight 'Cause I can't make you love me
If you don't
You can't make your heart feel
Something that it won't
And even in the dark
These final hours

But you won't
No, you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me
When you don't
When you don't, ooh don't
You, when you don't, yeah, yeah Hold me closer, one more time
Say that you love me in your last goodbye
Please forgive me, for my sins
Yes, I swam dirty waters
But you pushed me in
I've seen your face, under every sky
Over every border and on every line
You know my heart, more than I do
We were the greatest, me and you But we had time against us
And miles between us
The heavens cried
I know I left you speechless
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue
And I see my future in you I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll do everything different
I'll be better to you,
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll be somebody different
I'll be better to you Let me stay here for just one more night
Build your world around me
And pull me to the light
So I can tell you that I was wrong
I was a child then, but now I'm willing to learn But we had time against us
And miles between us
The heavens cried
I know I left you speechless
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue
And I see my future in you I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll do everything different
I'll be better to you
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll be somebody different
I'll be better to you Time against us
Miles between us
Heavens cried
I know I left you speechless
Time against us
Miles between us
Heavens cried
I know I left you speechless
I know I left you speechless I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll do everything different
I'll be better to you
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll be somebody different
I'll be better for you This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the Earth move, and then
Hear my heart burst again For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue, I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
At sky fall
at sky fall Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number
You can take my name
But you'll never have my heart Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
At sky fall Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me with out the security
Of your loving arms keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand.... Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
At sky fall Let the sky fall
We will stand tall
At skyfall (Verse 1)
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go head and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark Chorus 1
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling, we could've had it all... (You're gonna wish you never met me)
Rolling in the deep... (Tears are gonna fall rollin' in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never met me)
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall rollin' in the deep) Verse 2
Baby I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Making a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared (Chorus 2)
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling, we could've had it all
Rolling in the deep... you had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it to the beat
Could've had it all... Rollin' in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating (Verse 3)
Throw your stone through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow (Chorus 3)
We could've had it all... We could've had it all...
It all, It all, It all... We could've had it all...
Rollin' in the deep...
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it to the beat
Could've had it all
Rollin' in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it, you played it, you played it, you played it to the beat Some say, I'll be better without you,
They don't know you like I do,
Or at least as far as I thought I knew
I can't bear this time,
It drags, as I lose my mind
Reminded by things I find
I know some clothes you left behind.
Wake me up, wake me up when all is done
I won't rise until this battle's won
My dignity is become undone But I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go, I can't do it on my own,
If this is ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk So petrified, I'm so scared to step into this right,
What if I lose my heart and fail the ?
I won't forgive me if I gave up trying
I heard his voice today
I didn't know a single word he said
Now I'm resemblance to the man I met
Just a vague and broken boy instead But I won't go, I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go, I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk There will be times, we'll try and give it up
Bursting at the seams, no doubt
We almost fall apart and burn up easy
So watch them turn to dust
But nothing will never taint us I won't go, I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go, I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk Will he, will he still remember me?
Will he still love me even when he's free
Or will he go back to the place where
He will choose the poison over me?
When we spoke yesterday
He said to hold my breath, to sit and wait
I'll be home soon, I won't be late He won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
He's willing to take the risk
So I won't go, I can't do it on his own,
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk 'Cause he won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
We're willing to take the risk
I won't go! I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk I let it fall, my heart,
And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands, they're strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,
Your name When I lay with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together nothing gets better 'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name,
Your name I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Well, it felt something died
'Cause I knew that that was
The last time, the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door,
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,
Your name I set fire to the rain,
And I threw us into the flames
Well, it felt something died
'Cause I knew that, that was the last time
The last time Let it burn
Let it burn
Let it burn Daydreamer
Sitting on the sea
Soaking up the sun
He is a real lover
And making up the past
Feeling up his girl
Like he's never felt a figure before A jaw dropper
Looks good when he walks
Is the subject of their talk
He would be hard to chase
But good to catch
And he could change the world
With his hands behind his back, oh You can find him sittin' on your doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And you can tell that he'll be there for life Daydreamer
With eyes that make you melt
He lends his coat for shelter
Plus he's there for you
When he shouldn't be
But he stays all the same
Waits for you
Then sees you through There's no way I
Could describe him
What I'll say is
Just what I'm hoping for But I will find him sittin' on my doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And I can tell that he'll be there for life
And I can tell that he'll be there for life With your loving, there ain't nothing
That I can't adore
The way I'm running, with you, honey
Is we can break every low
I find it funny that you're the only
One I never looked for
There is something in your loving
That tears down my walls I wasn't ready then, I'm ready now
I'm heading straight for you
You will only be eternally
The one that I belong to The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I've known I'll forever be whatever you want me to be
I'll go under and all over for your clarity
When you wonder if I'm gonna lose my way home
Just remember, that come whatever, I'll be yours all alone I wasn't ready then, I'm ready now
I'm heading straight for you
You will only be eternally
The one that I belong to The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I've known I've been looking for you, baby
In every face that I've ever known
And there is something 'bout the way you love me
That finally feels like home
All my life, you're my darkness
You're the right kind of madness
And you're my hope, you're my despair
You're my scope, everything, everywhere The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I've known Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Devotion [Verse 1]
When did it go wrong, I will never know
I have loved you all my life
How did it slow down, I go round and round
Thinking about it all the time [Pre-Chorus]
I gave you heaven on a platter baby
I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me
This love, it ain't over yet
There's too much that I haven't said [Chorus]
Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write, had a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go [Verse 2]
Why were you so cold, let the truth be told
Tell me was it all for the thrill?
What was I thinking, I gave you everything
But you still went for the kill [Pre-Chorus]
I gave you heaven on a platter baby
I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me [Chorus]
Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write, had a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go [Bridge]
Oooh sometimes I feel like I'm in the dark
Oooh I thought I'd die in your arms [Chorus]
Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write, I had a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go [Outro]
Hope you know, I won't let go I thought I told you, he'd be home soon
Couldn't help myself, you're too good to be true.
I fall short each time,
Every time he ain't here
You and your charm creep closer
Closer and near
Like a fool for fire, I fall, with my pride and all.
Like a bomb before explosion,
Ticking by your call,
You're the wiser one, disguised from greed,
And I'm just a child who belongs on her knees. But I found a boy who I love more,
Than I ever did you before,
So stand beside the river I cried,
And lay yourself down.
Look how you want me now that I don't need you. So, you thought that I'd crumble to my knees
At the first sight of you crawling back to me
To whisper "will you leave your man? "
Cause you swear that this time you can stand by me.
I won't stand by you. Cause I found a boy who I love more,
Than I ever did you before,
So stand beside the river I cried
And lay yourself down.
Look how you want me now that I don't need you! I ain't yours for no taking,
You must be mistaken
I could never look into your eyes, and settle for wrong
And ignore the right When I found a boy who loves me more,
Than you ever did me before.
So stand beside the river you cried
And lay yourself down!
Look how you want me now that I don't need you! Found myself today singing out your name,
You said I'm crazy,
If I am I'm crazy for you. Sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here
Turns me crazy,
But it's you who makes me lose my head. And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head
And turn me into a crumbling fool. Tell me to run and I'll race,
If you want me to stop I'll freeze,
And if you want me gone. I'll leave, just hold me closer baby,
And make me crazy for you.
Crazy for you. Lately with this state I'm in I can't help myself but spin.
I wish you'd come over,
Send me spinning closer to you. My oh my, how my blood boils, it's sweet taste for you,
Strips me down bare
And gets me into my favorite mood. I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away,
But the more I do,
The crazier I turn into. Pacing floors and opening doors,
Hoping you'll walk through
And save me boy,
Because I'm too crazy for you.
Crazy for you Everybody tells me it's 'bout time that I moved on
And I need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young
But my heart is a valley, it's so shallow and man made
I'm scared to death if I let you in that you'll see I'm just a fake
Sometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch
But I know that's just me, 'cause nothing ever is enough
When I was a child I grew up by the River Lea
There was something in the water, now that something's in me
Oh I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river But it's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain But it's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea I should probably tell you now before it's way too late
That I never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face
Consider this my apology, I know it's years in advance
But I'd rather say it now in case I never get the chance
No, I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river But it's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain It's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea I never woulda hitch-hiked to Birmingham
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda caught the train to Louisiana
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda run through the blindin' rain
Without one dollar to my name
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love I never woulda seen the trouble that I'm in
If it hadn't been for love
Woulda been gone like a wayward wind
If it hadn't been for love
Nobody knows it better than me
I wouldn't be wishing I was free
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love Four cold walls against my will
At least I know he's lying still
Four cold walls without parole
Lord have mercy on my soul Four cold walls against my will
At least I know he's lying still
Four cold walls without parole
Lord have mercy on my soul I never woulda hitch-hiked to Birmingham
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda caught the train to Louisiana
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda loaded up a forty-four
Put myself behind a jailhouse door
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love, yes
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love, yes Hold my hand while you cut me down
It had only just begun but now it's over now
And you're in the heat of moments with your heart playing up cold
I'm between the middle watching hastiness unfold
On my eyes you were smiling in the spotlight dancing with the night
The night
When I fell off your mind I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Oy, I'm tired Where'd you go when you stayed behind
I looked up and inside down and outside only to find
A double taking punching hard and laughing at my smile
I get closer you obviously prefer her I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Oy, I'm tired (I should have known) Never mind said your open arms
I couldn't help believe they tricked me back into them, even though I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Oy, I'm tired Who wants to be right as rain
It's better when something is wrong
You get excitement in your bones
And everything you do's a game
When night comes and you're on your own
You can say I chose to be alone
Who wants to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top 'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love Who wants to be riding high
When you'll just crumble back on down
You give up everything you are
And even then you don't get far
They make believe that everything
Is exactly what it seems
But at least when you're at your worst
You know how to feel things 'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love Go ahead and still my heart
To make me cry again
'Cause it will never hurt
As much as it did then
We were both right
And no one had blame
But now I give up
On this endless game 'Cause who wants to be right as rain
It's better when something is wrong
I get excitement in my bones
Even though everything's a strain
When night comes and I'm on my own
You should know I chose to be alone
Who wants to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top 'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love No room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love So little to say but so much time
Despite my empty mouth the words are in my mind
Please wear the face, the one where you smile
Because you lighten up my heart when I start to cry Forgive me first love, but I'm tired
I need to get away to feel again
Try to understand why, don't get so close to change my mind
Please wipe that look out of your eyes, it's bribing me to doubt myself
Simply, it's tiring This love has dried up and stayed behind
And if I stay I'll be alive
Then choke on words I'd always hide
Excuse me first love, but we're through
I need to taste the kiss from someone new Forgive me first love, but I'm too tired
I'm bored to say the least and I, I lack desire
Forgive me first love, forgive me first love, forgive me first love
Forgive me first love forgive me, forgive me first love, forgive me first love This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the earth move and then
Hear my heart burst again For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen Let the skyfall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together Let the skyfall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall
At skyfall Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number, you can take my name
But you'll never have my heart Let the skyfall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together Let the skyfall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together
At skyfall [x2:]
(Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall) Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me
Without the security
Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand Let the skyfall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together Let the skyfall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together
At skyfall Let the sky fall
We will stand tall
At skyfall This is how the story went
I met someone by accident
It blew me away
Blew me away It was in the darkest of my days
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
And buried them away, you buried them away I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away Dropped you off at the train station
Put a kiss on top of your head
Watch you wave
And watched you wave Then I went on home to my skyscrapers
And neon lights and waiting papers
That I call home
I call that home I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away, away Woke up feeling heavy-hearted
I'm going back to where I started
The morning rain, the morning rain
And though I wish that you were here
On that same old road that brought me here
It's calling me home, It's calling me home I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away
I can't spend my whole life hiding my heart away Right under my feet there's air made of bricks
Pulls me down turns me weak for you
I find myself repeating like a broken tune
And I'm forever excusing your intentions
That I give in to my pretendings
Which forgive you each time
Without me knowing
They melt my heart to stone And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love Each and every time I turn around to leave
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
So desperately I try to link it with my head
But instead I fall back to my knees
As you tear your way right through me
I forgive you once again
Without me knowing
You've burnt my heart to stone And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love Why do you steal my hand
Whenever I'm standing my own ground
You build me up, then leave me dead I hear your words you made up
I say your name like there should be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one, in love
I'm the only one in love Fool that I am for falling in love with you
And fool that I am for thinking you loved me too You took my heart then played the part of little coquette
And my dreams just disappeared like the smoke from a cigarette Fool that I am for hoping you'd understand
And thinking you would listen to all of the things
The things I had planned But we couldn't see eye to eye
So darling
Darling
Darling this is goodbye Oh
I still care
Fool that I am
Ooh
I still care
Fool that I am You say it's all in my head
And the things I think just don't make sense
So where you been then? Don't go all coy
Don't turn it round on me like it's my fault
See I can see that look in your eyes
The one that shoots me each and every time You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her These days when I see you
You make it look like I'm see-through
Do tell me why you waste our time
When your heart ain't in it, and you're not satisfied
You know I know just how you feel
I'm starting to find myself feeling that way too When you grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her Time and time again, I play the role of fool
(Just for you)
Even in the daylight when you think that
(I don't see you)
Try to look for things I hear but our eyes never find
Though I do know how you play You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her [Adele]
Why do you love me
Do you love me...?
Why do you love me
Do you love me?
Why do you love me
Do you love me? Why do you love me...? Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me? Why do you love me?
There must be something in the water
Cause baby I'm in deeper than I knew
How do you keep me coming back for more
After all we've been through
I can't decide if I should run and hide It's above and beyond me
It's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy
It's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me... Who knows why I love you
It could be something in the air I breath
Whatever it is, I depend on it
Where does the time go?
I spend every single moment daydreaming of you
I can't describe how I feel, it feels right It's above and beyond me
It's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy
It's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me You were a shock in the dark that blew me away
And you left your mark and it never will fade
You ignited a spark, let the fires away
Are you ready, ready?
You have a place in my heart that will always be yours
You are the peak and art of my universe
Every piece and part, you were the first
I am ready, ready It's above and beyond me,
It's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you It's above and beyond me,
It's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me... Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me? You said I'm stubborn and I never give in
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that
I think you're giving out in way too much in fact
I say we've only known each other a year
You say I've known you longer my dear
You like to be so close, I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
Walking with each other,
Think we'll never match at all, but we do
But we do, but we do, but we do I thought I knew myself, somehow you know me more
I've never known this, never before
You're the first to make up whenever we argue
I don't know who I'd be if I didn't know you
You're so provocative, I'm so conservative
You're so adventurous, I'm so very cautious, combining
You think we would and we do,
But we do, but we do, but we do Favoritism ain't my thing but,
In this situation I'll be glad Favoritism ain't my thing but,
In this situation I'll be glad to make an exception You said I'm stubborn and I never give in
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that
I think you're giving out in way too much in fact
I say we've only known each other one year
You say I've known you longer my dear
You like to be so close, I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
Walking with each other,
Think we'll never match at all, but we do In the darkness of my heart is a shadow of your face
From the deepest part of my regret
I hear the words I wish I'd said
At the dawning of the day
I can't wait to see the light
Make up memories in my head
They help to fill the emptiness you've left
I can't drown in your tears
I won't face your fears
I need to fight my own
You'll never see me again oh baby in time
Let the weight take me under
I know I'll survive
You'll never see me again At the dawning of the day
I can't bare to see the light
Make up memories in my head
They help to fill the emptiness you've left
I can't drown in your tears
I won't face your fears
I need to fight my own
You'll never see me again oh baby in time
Let the weight take me under
I know I'll survive Let the floor beneath of me fall
Let the sky come crashing down
Turn all my right to wrong
But after you that goes on
You'll never see me again
I've been learning to live without you
It's taken all of my stake
But I'm stronger now You'll never see me again oh baby in time
Let the weight take me under
I know I'll survive Let the floor beneath of me fall
Let the sky come crashing down
Turn all my right to wrong
But after you that goes on
You'll never see me again
You'll never see me again
You'll never see me again I want to see your face in every kind of light
In fields of dawn and forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make What are you doing the rest of your life?
North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me I want to see your face in every kind of light
In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes
In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes
It may take a kiss or two Through all of my life
Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall of my life
All I ever will recall of my life
Is all of my life with you Wait, do you see my heart on my sleeve?
It's been there for days on end and
It's been waiting for you to open up
Yours too baby, come on now
I'm trying to tell you just how
I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally
Say that it's always been me That's made you feel the way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last
Like I'm the one for you You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me
Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me Why is it every time I think I've tried my hardest
It turns out it ain't enough
You're still not mentioning love
What am I supposed to do to make you want me properly?
I'm taking these chances and getting nowhere
And though I'm trying my hardest you go back to her
And I think that I know things may never change
I'm still hoping one day I might hear you say I make you feel the way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last
Like I'm the one for you You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me
Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me But, despite the truth that I know
I find it hard to let go and give up on you
Seems I love the things you do
Like the meaner you treat me the more eager I am
To persist with this heartbreak and running around
And I will do until I'm finding myself you And make you feel a way you've never felt before
And be all you need so that you never want more
And you'll say all of the right things without a clue
And you'll be the one for me and me the one for you I let it fall, my heart,
And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands, they're strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,
Your name When I lay with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together nothing gets better 'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name,
Your name I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Well, it felt something died
'Cause I knew that that was
The last time, the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door,
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,
Your name I set fire to the rain,
And I threw us into the flames
Well, it felt something died
'Cause I knew that, that was the last time
The last time Let it burn
Let it burn
Let it burn [Adele]
I would never lie to you unless you tell me to...
Every part of me
All my words to hold
And hold against me
Why won't you let it be? Don't you ever say my love opened up your heart
No I'm not gonna do it standing up
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby
Won't you turn off the lights Lay me down
'til the morning!
Lay me down (through the night)
Lay me down (I can fall in)
Lay me down (Won't you)
Lay me down (I can baby)
Lay me down (Someone believe me) I would never break the rules unless you tell me to
You can read my mind, be it truth or lies
Lie down beside me, why won't you let it be? Don't you ever say my love opened up your heart
No I'm not gonna do it standing up
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights Lay me down ('til the morning)
Lay me down (through the night)
Lay me down (I can fall in)
Lay me down (Won't you)
Lay me down (I can baby)
Lay me down (Someone believe me) Lay down with me
Lay down with me
Lay down with me
Lay down with me Words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights Lay me down ('til the morning)
Lay me down (through the night)
Lay me down (I can fall in)
Lay me down (Won't you)
Lay me down (I can baby)
Lay me down
Someone believe me Never been a girl who used to cry
Didn`t show emotions, don`t know why
Didn`t wanna feel the pain inside, I guess But as the years keep going by,
you came along and changed my mind
I should leave the past behind me,
I should let you find me,
supposed to stay beside me
You were supposed to guide me,
through the ups and downs,
you were always gonna be around until the end I still think we could
`cause you and me, we`re good
And I`ll tell you why this hurts, 'cause I`m sober But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has put me through
Even when I've had too much,
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough So I pour myself another drink
whenever I start to think about you
`cause I do but I really don`t want to
but sometimes my dreams just come through And when I get there,
to a place where I see you in a kitchen
I start wishing for that thing and I don`t need you,
I don`t really wanna see you
and I don`t want you to see me,
you would think that I was crazy,
you might think that I wanna be close to you
but I`d rather wanna drink some Whisky
and maybe have a little sip `o wine
`cause right now it`s the only thing that makes me forget you were mine
but right now I am sober But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has put me through
Even when I've had too much,
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough I still think we could
(I`m not drunk enough)
`cause you and me, we`re good
`cause I`m sober But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has put me through
Even when I've had too much,
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough (I still think we could)
But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has put me through
(`cause you and me we`re good)
Even when I've had too much,
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough Think I've had enough
I must my way
I've fallen off the edge to find that I've gone blind
You're leading me astray
You haunt me like a ghost
And that scares me the most
There you are the devil on my shoulder
Smiling as the flames are growing colder
How can I believer what I have?
For a little confidence I'll grab But when my hand goes out don't take it for I'm trying to make it on my own
I fell it in my bones any minute now!
This train of thought will leave the statio
My impatience will come out to play
You've turned out to be the only face I see!
Running through the empty hallways I can tell that I am not alone You spin a web in every room
You spin a web in every room
And try to break the backbone that I've grown
Will I make my own path or wander where I'm thrown
Will I make my own path or wander where I'm thrown
Or wander where I'm thrown? When we used
To say goodnight
I'd always kiss
And hold you tight
But lately
You don't seem
To care
You close the door
And leave me
Standing there
Oh, honey
That's not fair
That's it
I quit
I'm movin' on The other night
We had a date
An you showed up
Two hours late
And though your hair
Was all in place
Somebody smeared
Their lipstick
On your face
Oh, they smeared it
Every place
Ye that's it honey
I quit I'm movin' on [Chorus]
You made me want you
You made me leave you
You made me tumble
And fall
But if I
Can't have you the way
I want you
I don't want you at all Baby, I can take a lot
'Cause I love
Everything you got
Though your kisses
Fill me
So if you got
Someone else
I gotta go
Oh, that you know
Ye that's it honey
I quit I'm movin' on [Chorus] Baby
I can take a lot
'Cause I love
Everything you got
Though your kisses
Fill me
So if you got
Someone else
I gotta go
Oh, that you know
So that's it baby
I quit I'm movin' on
Ye that's it baby
I quit now
I'm movin' on Don't ask me
What you know is true
Don't have to tell you
I love your precious heart I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never tear us apart We could live
For a thousand years
But if I hurt you
I'd make wine from your tears I told you
That we could fly
'Cause we all have wings
But some of us don't know why I
I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never ever tear us apart I know sometimes you're scared of the light
But how will you ever know if you never try
There's something new inside my heart
And it grabs like a child whenever we're apart
I see your face under every sky
I find the less I look, more I find
So let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want You know sometimes that I'm scared of the dark
But I'm feeling sun babe when I'm in your arms
You said my name in the dead of glory
You hold me alright
When I'm short of falling So let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want There will be times
When we'll try to give it up
Bursting out, it seems no doubt that will almost fall apart than burn to pieces
And we'll watch them turn to dust
But without each other, nothing is easy enough So let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
'cause you're the only one I want, yeah
You're the only one
Never gonna leave you
No, I'm never gonna leave you, no Go ahead, go ahead and smash it on the floor
Take whatever is left, and take it with you out the door
See if I cry
See if I shed a single sorry tear
Can't say that it's been that great
No in fact it's been a wasted worried year [Chorus]
Everybody sees
And everyone agrees
That you and I are wrong
And it's been that way to long
Take it as it comes
And be thankful when it's done
There's so many ways to act
And there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black Let it out, let it all out
Say what's on your mind
You can kick and scream and shout and say things that are so unkind
Yeah-see if I care, see if I stand firm or if I fall
Cause in the back of my mind, and on the tip of my tongue
Is the answer to it all [Chorus] Yeah there's many shades of black [Chorus] Cause there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
Yeah there's any shades of black
There's so many shades of black
Yeah there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
And there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black Go ahead... Last night she said
Oh, baby
I feel so down
Oh, and turned me off
When I feel left out
So I
I turned around
Oh, baby
I don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking
Out that door Well, I've been in town
For just about fifteen
Whole minutes now
Oh, baby, I feel so down
And I don't know why
I keep walking for miles But the people
They don't understand
No, girlfriends
They can't understand
Your grandsons
They won't understand
On top of this
I ain't ever
Gonna understand Last night she said
Oh, baby
Don't feel so down
Oh, and turned me off
When I feel left out
So I, I turned around
Oh, baby
I'm gonna be alright
It was a great big lie
Cuz I left that night
Yeah Oh, people
They don't understand
No, girlfriends
They don't understand
In spaceships
They won't understand
And me
I ain't ever
Gonna understand Last night she said
Oh, baby
I feel so down
She had turned me off
When I feel left out
So I
I turned around
Oh, little girl
I don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking
Out that door, yeah Painting pictures with my mind
Making memories using my eyes
Filling up my heart with golden stories
Who adds some spice to the rhythm of life, oh Welcome sunrise with the morning glory
I've changed my mind
There is no simple
I thought of me, I want to see
I want to feel my heartbeat so
With the world that you feel, leave I can feel the pressure pushing onto my heart
And it's teasing me
To scratch my itch and beat my drum
So I can start to begin what's begun Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories Running riots inside my soul
Fire burning and it's lighting me up
To scratch my itch and beat my drum
So I can finish what has begun Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories Sometimes the hole you left hurts
My heart so bad, it cuts through
The deepest parts of me and fills up my mouth with the words that cry
Out, I'm still trying to stay inside Hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts Our hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts Every now and then my memories ache
With empty ideas of the ones we'd have made it
But as time goes on and my age gets older
I love the ones I know, they're enough to picture the rest 'Cause heart break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh

Well, thank you. Thank you very much Look there she goes that girl is so peculiar
I wonder if she's feeling well
With a dreamy far-off look
And her nose stuck in a book
What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle Oh, isn't this amazing?
It's my favorite part because you'll see
Here's where she meets Prince Charming
But she won't discover that it's him 'til chapter three Now it's no wonder that her name means "beauty"
Her looks have got no parallel
But behind that fair facade
I'm afraid she's rather odd
Very diff'rent from the rest of us
She's nothing like the rest of us
Yes, diff'rent from the rest of us is Belle Wow! You didn't miss a shot, Gaston, You're the greatest
hunter in the whole world!
I know.
No beast alive stands a chance against you. Ha ha ha and
no girl, for that matter.
It's true, LeFou. And I've got my sights set on that one
Hmm the inventor's daughter
She's the one - the lucky girl I'm going to marry
But she's
The most beautiful girl in town.
I know, but
That makes her the best. And don't I deserve the best
Well, of course! I mean you do, but Right from the moment when I met her, saw her
I said she's gorgeous and I fell
Here in town there's only she
Who is beautiful as me
So I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle Look there he goes
Isn't he dreamy
Monsieur Gaston
Oh he's so cute
Be still my heart
I'm hardly breathing
He's such a tall, dark, strong and handsome brute Bonjour
Pardon
Good day
Mais oui
You call this bacon
What lovely grapes
Some cheese
Ten yards
One pound
'Scuse me
I'll get the knife
Please let me through
This bread
Those fish
It's stale
They smell
Madame's mistaken There must be more than this provincial life
Just watch, I'm going to make Belle my wife Look there she goes a girl who's strange but special
A most peculiar mademoiselle
It's a pity and a sin
She doesn't quite fit in
'Cause she really is a funny girl
A beauty but a funny girl
She really is a funny girl
That Belle Master, I don't think you quite realize what you got here!
So, why don't you just ruminate,
Whilst I illuminate the possibilities! Well, Ali Baba had them forty thieves,
Scheherazade had a thousand tales.
But master you're in luck, 'cause up your sleeves
You've got a brand of magic never fails You've got some power in your corner now!
Some heavy ammunition in your camp!
You got some punch, pizzaz, yahoo and how...
See, all you gotta do is rub that lamp, and I'll say: Chorus:
"Mr. Aladdin, sir, what will your pleasure be?
Let me take your order, jot it down?"
You ain't never had friend like me Life is your restaurant and I'm your maitre'd
Come on whisper what it is you want;
You ain't never had friend like me! Yes sir, we pride ourselves on service.
You're the boss, the king, the shah.
Say what you wish; it's yours, true dish.
How 'bout a little more baklava? Have some of column A try All of column B,
I'm in the mood to help you, dude.
You ain't never had friend like me Oh my. No no. My my my.
Can your friends do this?
Can your friends do that?
Can your friends pull this
Out their little hat?
Can your friends go poof?
Well looky here!
Can your friends go abracadabra, let her rip,
And then make the sucker disappear? So don't just sit there slack-jawed, buggy-eyed,
I'm here to answer all your midnight prayers,
You've got me bona fide certified;
You've got a genie for charge d'affaires. I've got a powerful urge to help you out,
So what you wish, I really wanna know?
You've got a list that's three miles long, no doubt,
Well all you've gotta do is rub like so, and oh ­- Mr. Aladdin, sir, have a wish or two or three.
I'm on the job you big nabob!
You ain't never had a friend, never had a friend,
You ain't never had a friend, never had a friend,
You ain't never had a friend like me.
You ain't never had a friend like me The seaweed is always greener
In somebody else's lake
You dream about going up there
But that is a big mistake
Just look at the world around you
Right here on the ocean floor
Such wonderful things surround you
What more is you lookin' for? Under the sea
Under the sea
Darling it's better
Down where it's wetter
Take it from me
Up on the shore they work all day
Out in the sun they slave away
While we devotin'
Full time to floatin'
Under the sea Down here all the fish is happy
As off through the waves they roll
The fish on the land ain't happy
They sad 'cause they in their bowl
But fish in the bowl is lucky
They in for a worser fate
One day when the boss get hungry
Guess who's gon' be on the plate? Under the sea
Under the sea
Nobody beat us
Fry us and eat us
In fricassee
We what the land folks loves to cook
Under the sea we off the hook
We got no troubles
Life is the bubbles
Under the sea (Under the sea)
Under the sea (Under the sea) Since life is sweet here
We got the beat here
Naturally (Naturally)
Even the sturgeon an' the ray
They get the urge 'n' start to play
We got the spirit
You got to hear it
Under the sea The newt play the flute
The carp play the harp
The plaice play the bass
And they soundin' sharp
The bass play the brass
The chub play the tub
The fluke is the duke of soul
(Yeah)
The ray he can play
The lings on the strings
The trout rockin' out
The blackfish she sings
The smelt and the sprat
They know where it's at
An' oh that blowfish blow Yeah, under the sea (Under the sea)
Under the sea (Under the sea)
When the sardine
Begin the beguine
It's music to me (It's music to me)
What do they got? A lot of sand
We got a hot crustacean band
Each little clam here
Know how to jam here
Under the sea
Each little slug here
Cuttin' a rug here
Under the sea
Each little snail here
Know how to wail here
That's why it's hotter
Under the water
Ya we in luck here
Down in the muck here
Under the sea [Gramma Tala:]
I know a girl from an island
She stands apart from the crowd
She loves the sea and her people
She makes her whole family proud
Sometimes the world seems against you
The journey may leave a scar
But scars can heal and reveal just
Where you are The people you love will change you
The things you have learned will guide you
And nothing on earth can silence
The quiet voice still inside you
And when that voice starts to whisper
Moana you've come so far
Moana listen
Do you know who you are? [Moana:]
Who am I?
I am a girl who loves my island
I'm the girl who loves the sea
It calls me
I am the daughter of the village chief
We are descended from voyagers
Who found their way across the world
They call me
I've delivered us to where we are
I have journeyed farther
I am everything I've learned and more
Still it calls me
And the call isn't out there at all, it's inside me
It's like the tide; always falling and rising
I will carry you here in my heart you'll remind me
That come what may
I know the way
I am Moana! The only way to get what you want is to become a human yourself
Can you do that? My dear, sweet child, that's what I do
It's what I live for
To help unfortunate merfolk like yourself
Poor souls with no one else to turn to I admit that in the past I've been a nasty
They weren't kidding when they called me, well, a witch
But you'll find that nowadays
I've mended all my ways
Repented, seen the light, and made a switch
To this
And I fortunately know a little magic
It's a talent that I always have possessed
And dear lady, please don't laugh
I use it on behalf
Of the miserable, the lonely, and depressed (Pathetic) Poor unfortunate souls
In pain, in need
This one longing to be thinner
That one wants to get the girl
And do I help them?
Yes, indeed
Those poor unfortunate souls
So sad, so true
They come flocking to my cauldron
Crying, "Spells, Ursula, please!"
And I help them
Yes I do Now it's happened once or twice
Someone couldn't pay the price
And I'm afraid I had to rake 'em 'cross the coals
Yes I've had the odd complaint
But on the whole I've been a saint
To those poor unfortunate souls Have we got a deal?
If I become human, I'll never be with my father or sisters again
But you'll have your man
Life's full of tough choices, isn't it?
Oh, and there is one more thing
We haven't discussed the subject of payment
But I don't have-
I'm not asking much, just a token really, a trifle
What I want from you is your voice
But without my voice, how can I-
You'll have your looks, your pretty face
And don't underestimate the importance of body language, ha! The men up there don't like a lot of blabber
They think a girl who gossips is a bore
Yet on land it's much preferred for ladies not to say a word
And after all dear, what is idle babble for?
Come on, they're not all that impressed with conversation
True gentlemen avoid it when they can
But they dote and swoon and fawn
On a lady who's withdrawn
It's she who holds her tongue who gets a man Come on you poor unfortunate soul
Go ahead
Make your choice
I'm a very busy woman and I haven't got all day
It won't cost much
Just your voice!
You poor unfortunate soul
It's sad but true
If you want to cross the bridge, my sweet
You've got the pay the toll
Take a gulp and take a breath
And go ahead and sign the scroll
Flotsam, Jetsam, now I've got her, boys
The boss is on a roll
This poor unfortunate soul Beluga sevruga
Come winds of the Caspian Sea
Larengix glaucitis
Et max laryngitis
La voce to me Now, sing
Aa-aa-aah, a-aa-aah
Keep singing!
Aa-aa-aah, a-aa-aah (Spoken) Mama, I don't have time for dancing
(Sung) That's just gonna have to wait a while
Ain't got time for messing around
And it's not my style This old town can slow you down
People taking the easy way
But I know exactly where I'm going
I'm getting closer and closer everyday And I'm almost there
I'm almost there
People 'round here think I'm crazy
But I don't care Trials and tribulations
I've had my share
But there ain't nothing gonna stop me now
Cause I'm almost there I remember daddy told me
"Fairy tales can come true
But you gotta make it happen
It all depends on you" So I work real hard each and everyday
Now things for sure are going my way
Just doing what I do
Look out boys I'm coming through And I'm almost there
I'm almost there
People gonna come here from everywhere
And I'm almost there I'm almost there There's been trials and tribulations
You know I've had my share
But I've climbed a mountain, I've crossed a river
And I'm almost there I'm almost there I'm almost there I know you
I walked with you
Once Upon a dream
I know you That gleam in your eyes
Is so familiar a gleam
Yet I know it's true
That visions are seldom what they seem But if I know you
I know what you do
You'll love me at once
The way you did once upon a dream La da la da la ahahahahah
But if I know you
I know what you do
You'll love me at once The way you did once upon a dream
I know you
I walked with you
Once Upon a dream I know you
That gleam in your eyes
Is so familiar a gleam
Yet I know it's true That visions are seldom what they seem
But if I know you
I know what you do
You'll love me at once The way you did once upon a dream The King and his men
stole the queen from her bed,
and bound her in her bones.
The seas be ours, and by the powers;
where we will, we'll roam. Yo ho, all hands,
hoist the colors high.
Heave ho, thieves and beggars;
never shall we die. Now, some have died and some are alive
and others sail on the sea.
With the keys to the cage
and the devil to pay,
we lay to the fiddler's green. Yo ho haul together,
hoist the colors high.
Heave ho, thieves and beggars;
never shall we die. The bell has been raised
from its watery grave,
hear its sepulchral tone.
A call to all; pay heed the squall,
and turn your sails to home. Yo ho, haul together,
hoist the colors high.
Heave ho, thieves and beggars;
never shall we die. Yo ho, haul together,
hoist the colors high.
Heave ho, thieves and beggars;
never shall we die. Yo ho, haul together,
hoist the colors high.
Heave ho, thieves and beggars;
never shall we die. The king and his men
stole the queen from her bed,
and bound her in her bones.
The seas be ours, and by the powers;
where we will; we'll roam. So many times out there
I've watched a happy pair of lovers walking in the night
They had a kind of glow around them
It almost looked like heaven's light I knew I'd never know that warm and loving glow
Though I might wish with all my might
No face as hideous as my face
Was ever meant for heaven's light But suddenly an angel has smiled at me
And kissed my cheek without a trace of fright I dare to dream that she might even care for me
And as I ring these bells tonight
My cold dark tower seems so bright
I swear it must be Heaven's light Confiteor deo omnipotenti
(I confess to God almighty)
Beatae Mariae semper virgini
(To blessed Mary ever virgin)
Beato Michaeli archangelo
(To the blessed Archangel Michael)
Sanctis apostolis omnibus sanctis
(To the Holy Apostles, to all the saints) Beata Maria, you know I am a righteous man
Of my virtue I am justly proud
Et tibit Pater
(And to you, Father) Beata Maria, you know I'm so much purer than
The common, vulgar, weak, licentious crowd
Quia peccavi nimis
(That I have sinned) Then tell me, Maria, why I see her dancing there?
Why her smold'ring eyes still scorch my soul
Cogitatione
(In thought) I feel her, I see her, the sun caught in her raven hair
Is blazing in me out of all control
Verbo et opere
(In word and deed) Like fire, Hellfire
This fire in my skin
This burning desire
Is turning me to sin
It's not my fault Mea culpa
(Through my fault)
I'm not to blame
Mea culpa
(Through my fault) It is the gypsy girl
The witch who sent this flame
Mea maxima culpa
(Through my most grievous fault)
It's not my fault
Mea culpa
(Through my fault) If in God's plan
Mea culpa
(Through my fault)
He made the devil so much
Stronger than a man
Mea maxima culpa
(Through my most grievous fault) Protect me, Maria
Don't let this siren cast her spell
Don't let her fire sear my flesh and bone
Destroy Esmeralda
And let her taste the fires of hell
Or else let her be mine and mine alone Minister Frollo, the gypsy has escaped
What? No longer in the cathedral, she's gone
But how? Never mind, get out, you idiot
I'll find her, I'll find her if I have to burn down all of Paris Hellfire, dark fire
Now gypsy, it's your turn
Choose me or your pyre
Be mine or you will burn Kyrie Eleison
(Lord, have mercy)
God, have mercy on her
Kyrie Eleison
(Lord, have mercy) God, have mercy on me
Kyrie Eleison
(Lord, have mercy)
But she will be mine
Or she will burn I'm gonna be a mighty king
So enemies beware!
Well, I've never seen a king of beasts
With quite so little hair
I'm gonna be the mane event
Like no king was before I'm brushing up on looking down
I'm working on my ROAR
Thus far, a rather uninspiring thing
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!
(You've rather a long way to go, young master
if you think) No one saying do this
(Now when I said that, I)
No one saying be there
(What I meant was)
No one saying stop that
(Look, what you don't realize) No one saying see here
(Now see here!)
Free to run around all day
(Well, that's definitely out)
Free to do it all my way!
I think it's time that you and I Arranged a heart to heart
Kings don't need advice
From little hornbills for a start
If this is where the monarchy is headed
Count me out!
Out of service, out of Africa I wouldn't hang about
This child is getting wildly out of wing
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!
Everybody look left
Everybody look right
Everywhere you look I'm Standing in spotlight!
Not yet!
Let every creature go for broke and sing
Let's hear it in the herd and on the wing
It's gonna be King Simba's finest fling
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!
Oh, I just can't wait to be king! A word's just a word
'Til you mean what you say
And love isn't love
'Til you give it away We've all got a gift
Yeah, something to give
To make a change Send it on, on and on
Just one hand can heal another
Be a part, reach a heart
Just one spark starts a fire With one little action
The chain reaction will never stop
Make it strong
Shine a light, and send it on Just smile, and the world
Will smile along with you
That small act of love
Is meant for one who become two If we take the chances
To change circumstances
Imagine all we can do If we send it on, on and on
Just one hand can heal another
Be a part, reach a heart
Just one spark starts a fire With one little action
The chain reaction will never stop
Make it strong
Shine a light, and send it on
Send it on, ooh, send it on There's power in all
Of the choices we make
So I'm starting now
There's not a moment to waste A word's just word

Shine a light, and send it on Every time she'd find a minute
That's the time that they begin it
Cinderelly, Cinderelly (Cinderella!) Cinderelly, Cinderelly
Night and day it's Cinderelly
Make the fire, fix the breakfast
Wash the dishes, do the mopping
And the sweeping and the dusting
They always keep her hopping
She goes around in circles till she's very, very dizzy
Still they holler "Keep a-busy, Cinderelly!" We can do it, we can do it
We can help our Cinderelly
We can make her dress so pretty
There's nothing to it, really
We'll tie a sash around it
Put a ribbon through it
When dancing at the ball she'll be more beautiful than all
In the lovely dress we'll make for Cinderelly! Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry
Gonna help our Cinderelly
Got no time to dilly-dally
We gotta get a-goin'
I'll cut it with these scissors!
And I can do the sewing!
Leave the sewing to the women
You go get some trimmin'
And we'll make a lovely dress for Cinderelly, whoo! We'll make a lovely dress for Cinderelly! Morning in Paris, the city awakes
To the bells of Notre Dame
The fisherman fishes, the bakerman bakes
To the bells of Notre Dame
To the big bells as loud as the thunder
To the little bells soft as a psalm
And some say the soul of the city is
The toll of the bells
The bells of Notre Dame Dark was the night when our tale was begun
On the docks near Notre Dame Four frightened gypsies slid silently under
The docks near Notre Dame But a trap had been laid for the gypsies
And they gazed up in fear and alarm
At a figure whose clutches
Were iron as much as the bells The bells of Notre Dame (Kyrie Eleison)
Judge Claude Frollo longed
To purge the world
Of vice and sin
(Kyrie Eleison)
And he saw corruption
Ev'rywhere
Except within Dies irae, dies illa
(Dies irae, dies illa)
Dies irae, dies illa
(Dies irae, dies illa)
Solvet saeclum in favilla
Teste David cum sibylla
Quantus tremor est futurus
Quando Judex est venturus See there the innocent blood you have spilt
On the steps of Notre Dame Now you would add this child's blood to your guilt
On the steps of Notre Dame You can lie to yourself and your minions
You can claim that you haven't a qualm
But you never can run from
Nor hide what you've done from the eyes
The very eyes of Notre Dame (Kyrie Eleison)
And for one time in his live
Of power and control
(Kyrie Eleison)
Frollo felt a twinge of fear
For his immortal soul Just so he's kept locked away
Where no one else can see Even this foul creature may
Yet prove one day to be
Of use to me Now here is a riddle to guess if you can
Sing the bells of Notre Dame
Who is the monster and who is the man Sing the bells, bells, bells, bells
Bells, bells, bells, bells
Bells of Notre Dame I can show you the world
Shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me, princess, now when did
You last let your heart decide? I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But when I'm way up here, it's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with you
Now I'm in a whole new world with you Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky A whole new world
Don't you dare close your eyes
A hundred thousand things to see
(Hold your breath, it gets better) I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far
I can't go back
To where I used to be A whole new world
Every turn a surprise
With new horizons to pursue
Every moment red-letter I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you A whole new world
That's where we'll be
A thrilling chase
A wondrous place
For you and me Somewhere out there,
Beneath the pale moonlight,
Someone's thinking of me,
And loving me tonight. Somewhere out there,
Someone's saying a prayer,
That we'll find one another,
In that big somewhere out there. And even though I know how very far apart we are,
It helps to think we might be wishing on the same bright star,
And when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby,
It helps to think we're sleeping underneath the same big sky! Somewhere out there,
If love can see us through,
Then we'll be together,
Somewhere out there,
Out where dreams
Come true... There you see her
Sitting there across the way
She don't got a lot to say
But there's something about her
And you don't know why
But you're dying to try
You wanna kiss the girl Yes, you want her
Look at her, you know you do
Possible she wants you too
There is one way to ask her
It don't take a word
Not a single word
Go on and kiss the girl Sing with me now
Sha la la la la la
My oh my
Look like the boy too shy
Ain't gonna kiss the girl
Sha la la la la la
Ain't that sad?
Ain't it a shame?
Too bad, he gonna miss the girl Now's your moment
Floating in a blue lagoon
Boy, you better do it soon
No time will be better
She don't say a word
And she won't say a word
Until you kiss the girl Sha la la la la la
Don't be scared
You got the mood prepared
Go on and kiss the girl

Wonderful feeling, feeling this way! Mister Bluebird's on my shoulder
It is the truth, it's "actch'll", hm? Where is that bluebird? Everything is "satisfactch'll"
Zip-a-dee-doo-dah, zip-a-dee-ay
Wonderful feeling, wonderful day! Bless my soul
Herc was on a roll
Person of the week in every Greek opinion poll
What a pro!
Herc could stop a show
Point him at a monster and you're talking S.R.O. He was a no one
A zero, zero
Now he a hot shot
He's a hero
He was a kid with his act down pat
From zero to hero in no time flat
Zero to hero, just like that! When he smiled the girls went wild
With oohs and ahhs
And they slapped his face on ev'ry vase
(On every vahse) From appearance fees and royalties
Our Herc had cash to burn
Now nouveau riche and famous
He could tell you what's a Grecian "earn"! Say "Amen"
There he goes again
Sweet and undefeated
And an awesome 10 for 10
Folks lined up
Just to watch him flex
And this perfect package packed a pair of pretty pecs Hercie, he comes, he sees, he conquers
Honey, the crowds were going bonkers
He showed the moxie, brains, and spunk
From zero to hero
A major hunk
Zero to hero
And who'd have thunk? Who put the "glad" in "gladiator"?
Hercules!
Whose daring deeds are great theater?
Hercules!
Is he bold?
No one braver!
Is he sweet?
Our favorite flavor! Hercules, Hercules
Hercules, Hercules
Hercules, Hercules Bless my soul
Herc was on a roll
Undefeated
Riding high
And the nicest guy
Not conceited He was a nothin'
A zero, zero
Now he's a hot-shot
He's our hero
He hit the heights at breakneck speed! From zero to hero
Herc is a hero
Now he's a hero Yes indeed! Tale as old as time
True as it can be
Barely even friends
Then somebody bends
Unexpectedly. Just a little change
Small to say the least
Both a little scared
Neither one prepared
Beauty and the Beast Ever just the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before
Ever just as sure
As the sun will rise Tale as old as time
Tune as old as song
Bittersweet and strange
Finding you can change
Learning you were wrong Certain as the sun
Rising in the east
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast Think of a wonderful thought
Any merry little thought
Think of Christmas, think of snow
Think of sleigh bells off you go
Like reindeer in the sky You can fly
You can fly
You can fly Think of the happiest things
It's the same as having wings
Take the path that moonbeams make
If the moon is still awake
You'll see him wink his eye You can fly
You can fly
You can fly Up you go with a height and ho
To the stars beyond the blue
There's a Never Land waiting for you
Where all your happy dreams come true
Every dream that you dream will come true When there's a smile in your heart
There's no better time to start
Think of all the joy you'll find
When you leave the world behind
And bid your cares goodbye You can fly
You can fly
You can fly
You can fly
You can fly When there's a smile in your heart
There's no better time to start
Think of all the joy you'll find
When you leave the world behind
And bid your cares goodbye You can fly
You can fly
You can fly
You can fly
You can fly I've been standing at the edge of the water
Long as I can remember
Never really knowing why
I wish I could be the perfect daughter
But I come back to the water
No matter how hard I try Every turn I take
Every trail I track
Every path I make
Every road leads back to the place I know
Where I cannot go
Where I long to be See the light where the sky meets the sea
It calls me
No one knows how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know
If I go there's just no telling how far I'll go I know everybody on this island
Seems so happy on this island
Everything is by design
I know everybody on this island
Has a role on this island
So maybe I can roll with mine I can lead with pride
I can make us strong
I'll be satisfied if I play along
But the voice inside sings a different song
What is wrong with me See the light as it shines on the sea
It's blinding
But no one knows how deep it goes
And it seems like it's calling out to me
So come find me
And let me know
What's beyond that line
Will I cross that line See the light where the sky meets the sea
It calls me
And no one knows how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know
How far I'll go Well Tamatoa hasn't always been this glam
I was a drab little crab once
Now I know I can be happy as a clam
Because I'm beautiful baby Did your granny say listen to your heart?
Be who you are on the inside?
I need three words to tear her argument apart: your granny lied I'd rather be shiny
Like a treasure from a sunken pirate wreck
Scrub the deck and make it look shiny
I will sparkle like a wealthy woman's neck
Just a sec, don't ya know
Fish are dumb, dumb, dumb
They chase anything that glitters, beginners
Oh and here they come, come, come to the brightest thing that glitters
Mmm fish dinners
I just love free food (free food) and you look like sea food (sea food) Well, well, well
Little Maui's havin' trouble with his look
You little semi, demi, mini god
Ouch what a terrible performance get the hook
Get it?
You don't swing it like you used to, man
Yet I have to give you credit from my start
And your tattoos on the outside
For just like you I made myself a work of art
I'll never hide
I can't I'm too shiny
Watch me dazzle like a diamond in the rough
Strut my stuff, my stuff is so shiny
Send your armies but they'll never be enough
My shell's too tough, Maui man
You can try, try, try but you can't expect a demigod to beat a decapod
Look it up
You will die, die, die now it's time for me to take apart your achin' heart Far from the ones who abandoned you
Chasin' the love of the humans who made you feel wanted
You tried to be tough but your armor's just not hard enough
Maui, now it's time to kick your heiney
Ever seen someone so shiny Soak it in 'cause it's the last you'll ever see
C'est la vie, mon ami
I'm so shiny
Now I'll eat you so prepare your final plea just for me
You'll never be quite as shiny
You wish you were nice and shiny What I love most about rivers is
You can't step in the same river twice
The water's always changing, always flowing But people, I guess, can't live like that
We all must pay a price
To be safe, we lose our chance of ever knowing What's around the river bend
Waiting just around the river bend I look once more just around the river bend
Beyond the shore where the gulls fly free
Don't know what for what I dream the day might send
Just around the river bend for me, coming for me I feel it there beyond those trees
Or right behind these waterfalls
Can I ignore that sound of distant drumming? For a handsome sturdy husband who builds handsome sturdy walls
And never dreams that something might be coming? Just around the river bend
Just around the river bend I look once more just around the river bend
Beyond the shore somewhere past the sea
Don't know what for why do all my dreams extend
Just around the river bend, just around the river bend Should I choose the smoothest course
Steady as the beating drum? Should I marry Kocoum?
Is all my dreaming at an end?
Or do you still wait for me, dream giver
Just around the river bend? In every job that must be done
There is an element of fun
You find the fun and snap!
The job's a game And every task you undertake
Becomes a piece of cake
A lark! A spree! It's very clear to see that A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
The medicine go down, the medicine go down
Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
In a most delightful way A robin feathering his nest has very little time to rest
While gathering his bits of twine and twig
Though quite intent in his pursuit
He has a merry tune to toot
He knows a song will move the job along For a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
The medicine go down, the medicine go down
Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
In a most delightful way The honey bee that fetch the nectar from the flowers to the comb
Never tired of ever buzzing to and fro
Because they take a little nip from every flower that they sip
And hence (And hence)
They find (They find)
Their task is not a grind Ah, ah, ah! Ma chere Mademoiselle, it is with deepest pride
and greatest pleasure that we welcome you tonight,
And now we invite you to relax, let us pull up a

for a servant who's not serving

But the fire is so delightful

Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow When we finally kiss goodnight
How I hate going out in the storm
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm The fire is slowly dying
And my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow When we finally kiss goodnight
How I hate going out in the storm
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm The fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow As long as you love me so

It'll do magic, believe it or not
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo Yes, salagadoola means
Mechicka booleroo
But the thing mabob that does the job
Is bibbidi-bobbidi-boo I got myself a notion
And one I know that you'll understand
To set the world in motion by reaching out for each other's hand Maybe we'll discover
What we shoulda known all along
One way or another, together's where we both belong If we listen to each other's heart
We'll find we're never too far apart
And maybe love is a reason why
For the first time ever, we're seein' it eye to eye If a wall should come between us
Too high to climb, too hard to break through
I know that love'll lead us
And find a way to bring me to you So don't be in a hurry
Think before you count us out
You don't have to worry
I won't ever let you drown
(Nothing's gonna stop us now) If we listen to each other's heart
We'll find we're never too far apart
And maybe love is a reason why
For the first time ever, we're seein' it eye to eye Love is why we're seein' it eye to eye
(Yes, we are seein' it eye to eye)
Seein' it eye to
(Love is why we're seein' it)
I think we're seein' it eye to eye
(eye to eye)
eye to
We're seein' it eye to eye
(eye to eye!) If you're ever lonely, then stop!
You don't have to be
After all, it's only a beat away from you to me
(Take a look inside and see) If we listen to each other's heart
We'll find we're never too far apart
And maybe love is a reason why
For the first time ever, we're seein' it eye to eye Seein' it eye to
Seein' it eye to eye
We're seein' it eye to eye, baby
For the first time
For the first time eye to eye

Cruella De Vil
If she doesn't scare you
No evil thing will
To see her is to
Take a sudden chill
Cruella, Cruella
She's like a spider waiting
For the kill
Look out for Cruella De Vil At first you think
Cruella is the devil
But after time has worn
Away the shock
You come to realize
You've seen her kind of eyes
Watching you from underneath
A rock! This vampire bat
This inhuman beast
She ought to be locked up
And never released
The world was such
A wholesome place until
Cruella, Cruella De Vil Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries and your strife
I mean the bare necessities
Old Mother Nature's recipes
That brings the bare necessities of life Wherever I wander, wherever I roam
I couldn't be fonder of my big home
The bees are buzzin' in the tree
To make some honey just for me
When you look under the rocks and plants
And take a glance at the fancy ants
Then maybe try a few The bare necessities of life will come to you
They'll come to you! Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries and your strife
I mean the bare necessities
That's why a bear can rest at ease
With just the bare necessities of life Now when you pick a pawpaw
Or a prickly pear
And you prick a raw paw
Well next time beware
Don't pick the prickly pear by the paw
When you pick a pear
Try to use the claw
But you don't need to use the claw
When you pick a pear of the big pawpaw
Have I given you a clue? The bare necessities of life will come to you
They'll come to you! Oh man this is really living
So just try and relax, yeah cool it
Fall apart in my backyard
'Cause let me tell you something little britches
If you act like that bee acts, uh uh
You're working too hard And don't spend your time lookin' around
For something you want that can't be found
When you find out you can live without it
And go along not thinkin' about it
I'll tell you something true The bare necessities of life will come to you Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries and your strife
I mean the bare necessities
That's why a bear can rest at ease
With just the bare necessities of life
With just the bare necessities of life I see what's happening yeah
You're face to face with greatness and it's strange
You don't even know how you feel
It's adorable!
Well, it's nice to see that humans never change
Open your eyes, let's begin
Yes, it's really me
It's Maui, breathe it in
I know its a lot; the hair, the bod
When you're staring at a demigod What can I say except you're welcome
For the tides, the sun, the sky
Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome
I'm just an ordinary demi-guy Hey!
What has two thumbs and pulled up the sky
When you were waddling yay high
This guy!
When the nights got cold
Who stole you fire from down below
You're lookin' at him, yo
Oh!
Also I lassoed the sun
(You're welcome)
To stretch your days and bring you fun
Also I harnessed the breeze
(You're welcome!)
To fill your sails and shake your trees So what can I say except you're welcome
For the islands I pulled from the sea
There's no need to pray, it's okay, you're welcome
Ha! I guess it's just my way of being me
You're welcome!
You're welcome! Well, come to think of it
Kid, honestly I could go on and on
I could explain every natural phenomenon
The tide? The grass? The ground?
Oh, that was Maui just messin' around
I killed an eel, I buried its guts
Sprouted a tree, now you've got coconuts
What's the lesson? What is the takeaway?
Don't mess with Maui when he's on the breakaway And the tapestry here on my skin
Is a map of the victories I win
Look where I've been
I make everything happen
Look at that mean mini Maui just tickety-tappin'
Heh, heh, heh ,heh, heh, heh, hey! Well anyway, let me say you're welcome (You're welcome)
For the wonderful world you know
Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome (You're welcome)
Well, come to think of it, I gotta go!
Hey, it's your day to say you're welcome (You're welcome)
'Cause I'm gonna need that boat
I'm sailing away, away, you're welcome (You're welcome)
'Cause Maui can do anything but float! (You're welcome)
You're welcome! (You're welcome)

Disney
2000 Leagues Under the Sea
Got a whale of a tale to tell ya, lads
A whale of a tale or two
'Bout the flapping fish and girls I've loved
On nights like this with the moon above
A whale of a tale and it's all true,
I swear by my tatoo
There was Mermaid Minnie
Met her down in Madagascar
She would kiss me
Anytime that I would ask her
Then one evening
Her flame of love blew out
Blow me down and pick me up,
She swapped me for a trout!
Got a whale of a tale to tell ya, lads
A whale of a tale or two
'Bout the flapping fish and girls I've loved
On nights like this with the moon above
A whale of a tale and it's all true,
I swear by my tatoo
There was Typhoon Tessie
Met her on the coast of Java
When we kissed I
Bubbled up like molten lava
Then she gave me
The scare of my young life
Blow me down, and pick me up
She was the captain's wife!
Got a whale of a tale to tell ya, lads
A whale of a tale or two
'Bout the flapping fish and girls I've loved
On nights like this with the moon above
A whale of a tale and it's all true,
I swear by my tatoo
Then there was Harpoon Hannah
Had a face that made you shudder
Lips like Fish hooks
And a nose just like a rudder
If I kissed her
And held her tenderly
(Held her tenderly)
There's no sea monster big enough
To ever frighten me!
Got a whale of a tale to tell ya, lads
A whale of a tale or two
'Bout the flapping fish and girls I've loved
On nights like this with the moon above
A whale of a tale and it's all true,
I swear by my tatoo! With tuppence for paper and strings
You can have your own set of wings
With your feet on the ground
You're a bird in a flight
With your fist holding tight
To the string of your kite Oh, oh, oh!
Let's go fly a kite
Up to the highest height!
Let's go fly a kite and send it soaring
Up through the atmosphere
Up where the air is clear
Oh, let's go fly a kite! When you send it flyin' up there
All at once you're lighter than air
You can dance on the breeze
Over 'ouses and trees
With your first 'olding tight
To the string of your kite Oh, oh, oh!
Let's go fly a kite
Up to the highest height!
Let's go fly a kite and send it soaring
Up through the atmosphere
Up where the air is clear
Oh, let's go fly a kite! Want to know a secret?
Promise not to tell?
When you're standing by a wishing well
Make a wish into the well
That's all you have to do
And if you hear it echoing
Your wish will soon come true I'm wishing for the one I love
To find me today
I'm hoping
And I'm dreaming of
The nice things he'll say I'm wishing for the one I love
To find me today Today!
Now that I've found you
Hear what I have to say
One Song
I have but one song
One song
Only for you One heart
Tenderly beating
Ever entreating
Constant and true One love
That has possessed me
One love
Thrilling me through One song
My heart keeps singing
Of one love
Only for you Let's get down to business, to defeat the Huns
Did they send me daughters, when I asked for sons?
You're the saddest bunch I ever met
But you can bet before we're through
Mister, I'll make a man out of you Tranquil as a forest but on fire within
Once you find your center, you are sure to win
You're a spineless, pale, pathetic lot
And you haven't got a clue
Somehow I'll make a man out of you I'm never gonna catch my breath
Say goodbye to those who knew me
Boy, was I a fool in school for cutting gym
This guy's got 'em scared to death
Hope he doesn't see right through me
Now I really wish that I knew how to swim Be a man
We must be swift as the coursing river
Be a man
With all the force of a great typhoon
Be a man
With all the strength of a raging fire
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon Time is racing toward us till the Huns arrive
Heed my every order and you might survive
You're unsuited for the rage of war
So pack up, go home, you're through
How could I make a man out of you? Be a man
We must be swift as the coursing river
Be a man
With all the force of a great typhoon
Be a man
With all the strength of a raging fire
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon Be a man
We must be swift as the coursing river
Be a man
With all the force of a great typhoon
Be a man
With all the strength of a raging fire
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon (Ou mata e matagi)
I have crossed the horizon to find you
(Ou loto mamaina toa)
I know your name
(Manatu atu)
They have stolen the heart from inside you
(Taku pelepele)
But this does not define you
(Manatu atu)
This is not who you are
You know who you are Look at this stuff, isn't it neat?
Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?
Wouldn't you think I'm the girl
The girl who has everything?
Look at this trove, treasures untold
How many wonders can one cavern hold?
Lookin' around here you'd think
Sure, she's got everything I've got gadgets and gizmos aplenty
I've got whooz-its and whatz-its galore
You want thingamabobs?
I got twenty
But who cares?
No big deal
I want more I want to be where the people are
I want to see
Want to see 'em dancing
Walking around on those
Whadd'ya call 'em? Oh, feet
Flipping your fins you don't get too far
Legs are required for jumping, dancing
Strolling along down a
What's that word again? Street Up where they walk
Up where they run
Up where they stay all day in the sun
Wandering free
Wish I could be
Part of that world What would I give
If I could live
Out of these waters?
What would I pay
To spend a day
Warm on the sand?
Betcha on land
They understand
That they don't reprimand their daughters
Bright young women
Sick of swimming
Ready to stand And I'm ready to know what the people know
Ask 'em my questions
And get some answers
What's a fire and why does it
What's the word? Burn? When's it my turn?
Wouldn't I love
Love to explore that shore above?
Out of the sea
Wish I could be
Part of that world
Out of the sea
Wish I could be
Part of your world When somebody loved me
Everything was beautiful
Every hour we spent together
Lives within my heart And when she was sad
I was there to dry her tears
And when she was happy so was I
When she loved me Through the summer and the fall
We had each other that was all
Just she and I together
Like it was meant to be And when she was lonely
I was there to comfort her
And I knew that she loved me So the years went by
I stayed the same
She began to drift away
I was left alone Still I waited for the day
When she'd say
I will always love you Lonely and forgotten
Never thought she'd look my way
She smiled at me and held me Just like she used to do
Like she loved me
When she loved me When somebody loved me
Everything was beautiful
Every hour we spent together
Lives within my heart When she loved me, hey All those days watching from the windows
All those years outside looking in
All that time never even knowing
Just how blind I've been
Now I'm here blinking in the starlight
Now I'm here suddenly I see
Standing here it's all so clear
I'm where I'm meant to be And at last I see the light
And it's like the fog has lifted
And at last I see the light
And it's like the sky is new
And it's warm and real and bright
And the world has somehow shifted
All at once everything looks different
Now that I see you All those days chasing down a daydream
All those years living in a blur
All that time never truly seeing
Things, the way they were
Now she's here shining in the starlight
Now she's here suddenly I know
If she's here it's crystal clear
I'm where I'm meant to go And at last I see the light And it's like the fog has lifted And at last I see the light And it's like the sky is new And it's warm and real and bright
And the world has somehow shifted
All at once everything is different
Now that I see you Now that I see you Wonderful, marvelous,
The man with the strength of many.
Brave and bold with a heart of gold,
John Henry was a mighty man.
Born with a hammer right in his hand. Well, come on John,
You're the one that we're depending on.
Swing that hammer with all your might,
I know you can show them how to do it right. John Henry, John Henry,
John Henry is a mighty man.
Born with a hammer,
A ten pound hammer,
A twenty pound hammer right in his hand. I heard John's mama liked to sew at night,
So he pulled down the moon for a little bit of light.
It took a lot of cooking to keep John fed,
Ten dozen eggs and eight loves of bread. John Henry, John Henry,
John Henry is a mighty man.
Born with a hammer, born with a hammer,
Born with a hammer right in his hand. He plowed the earth so wide and deep,
The seed he sowed the ground had to keep.
His hammer hit the earth with such a mighty blow,
Everything he planted would jump up and grow. John Henry, John Henry,
John Henry is a powerful man.
All our lives we've been so poor,
John let me show you what we're working for. Canaan Land, Canaan Land,
Everybody workin' for the Canaan Land.
Home and freedom hand in hand,
Workin' for the Canaan Land. Oh, movin' on down the line,
John Henry came right on time.
Movin' on down the line,
John Henry came right on time. Home and freedom hand in hand,
Workin' for the Canaan Land. John Henry, John Henry,
John Henry is a mighty man.
John Henry, John Henry,
John Henry is a powerful man. Steel drivin' man,
John Henry was.
Steel drivin' man,
Oh yes he was.
So proud, defiant,
A gentle giant,
A steel drivin' natural man. Well, a-come on, John,
You're the one that we're dependin' on.
Swing that hammer, bust that rock,
Come on, give it everything you've got. John Henry, John Henry,
John Henry is a mighty man.
Born with a hammer, born with a hammer,
Born with a hammer right in his hand. John and the drill made the valley shake,
Rumblin' almost caused an earthquake.
Thunder and lightning was everywhere,
Oh, Lord, that battle was beyond compare. John Henry, John Henry,
John Henry is a powerful man.
Born with a hammer, born with a hammer,
Born with a hammer right in his hand. No mountain too high,
No valley too low,
No river too wide,
No place too far to go. If you believe, you can overcome.
The battle is already won,
Just keep on keepin' on.
Stand tall, just like John. No matter who you are,
No matter where you're from,
Nothing can stop you,
From who you can become. Just keep on keepin' on,
Stand tall, just like John.
Just keep on keepin' on,
Stand tall, just like John. No matter who you are,
No matter where you're from,
Nothing can stop you,
From who you can become. Just keep on keepin' on,
Stand tall, just like John.
Just keep on keepin' on,
Stand tall, just like John.
Just keep on keepin' on,
Stand tall, just like John.
Just keep on keepin' on,
Stand tall, just like John. Do you wanna build a snowman?
Come on let's go and play
I never see you anymore
Come out the door
It's like you've gone away We used to be best buddies
And now we're not
I wish you would tell me why!
Do you wanna build a snowman?
It doesn't have to be a snowman
Okay, bye Do you wanna build a snowman?
Or ride our bikes around the halls
I think some company is overdue
I've started talking to the
Pictures on the walls It gets a little lonely
All these empty rooms (these empty rooms)
Just watching the hours
Tick by Do you wanna build a snowman?
(Do you wanna build a snowman?)
It doesn't have to be a snowman
(Don't have to be a snowman)
Okay, bye Elsa?
Please, I know you're in there (I know you're in there)
People are asking where you've been
They say, "have courage" and I'm trying to (trying to)
I'm right out here for you (here for you)
Just let me in (just let me in) We only have each other (we only have each other)
It's just you and me
What are we gonna do? (what are we gonna do?) Do you wanna build a snowman?
Do you wanna build a snowman?
It doesn't have to be a snowman
Okay, bye Some day my prince will come
Some day we'll meet again
And away to his castle we'll go
To be happy forever I know Some day when spring is here
We'll find a love anew
And the birds will sing
And wedding bells will ring
Someday when my dreams come true La la lu, La la lu
Oh, my little star sweeper
I'll sweep the stardust for you La la lu, La la lu
Little soft fluffy sleeper
Here comes a pink cloud for you La la lu, La la lu
Little wandering angel
Fold up your wings close your eyes La la lu, La la lu
And may love be your keeper
La la lu, La la lu, La la lu Hakuna Matata!
What a wonderful phrase
Hakuna Matata!
Ain't no passing craze It means no worries
For the rest of your days
It's our problem-free philosophy
Hakuna Matata! Why, when he was a young warthog
When I was a young wart-hoooog!
Very nice!
Thanks!
He found his aroma lacked a certain appeal
He could clear the Savannah after every meal
I'm a sensitive soul, though I seem thick-skinned
And it hurt that my friends never stood downwind
And oh, the shame
(He was ashamed!)
Thought of changin' my name
(Oh, what's in a name?)
And I got downhearted
(How did you feel?)
Every time that I-
Pumbaa! Not in front of the kids!
Oh... sorry Hakuna Matata!
What a wonderful phrase
Hakuna Matata!
Ain't no passing craze
It means no worries
For the rest of your days
Yeah, sing it, kid!
It's our problem-free philosophy
Hakuna Matata! Hakuna Matata
Hakuna Matata
Hakuna Matata
Hakuna It means no worries
For the rest of your days
It's our problem-free philosophy
Hakuna Matata From the day we arrive on the planet
And blinking, step into the sun
There's more to see than can ever be seen
More to do than can ever be done There's far too much to take in here
More to find than can ever be found
But the sun rolling high
Through the sapphire sky
Keeps great and small on the endless round It's the circle of life
And it moves us all
Through despair and hope
Through faith and love Till we find our place
On the path unwinding
In the circle
The circle of life It's the circle of life
And it moves us all
Through despair and hope
Through faith and love Till we find our place
On the path unwinding
In the circle
The circle of life Mmmmmm
Mmmmmm
So this is love
Mmmmmm
So this is love
So this is what makes life divine
I'm all aglow, mmmmmm
And now I know
And now I know
The key to all heaven is mine
My heart has wings, mmmmmm
And I can fly
I'll touch every star in the sky
So this is the miracle
That I've been dreaming of
Mmmmmm
Mmmmmm
So this is love Oh, this is the night, it's a beautiful night
And we call it bella notte
Look at the skies, they have stars in their eyes
On this lovely bella notte Side by side with your loved one
You'll find enchantment here
The night will weave its magic spell
When the one you love is near For this is the night, and the heavens are right
On this lovely bella notte This is the night, it's a beautiful night
And we call it bella notte
Look at the skies, they have stars in their eyes
On this lovely bella notte Side by side with your loved one
You'll find enchantment here
The night will weave its magic spell
When the one you love is near For this is the night, and the heavens are right
On this lovely bella notte Look at me,
I will never pass for a perfect bride, or a perfect daughter.
Can it be,
I'm not meant to play this part?
Now I see, that if I were truly to be myself,
I would break my family's heart. Who is that girl I see, staring straight back at me?
Why is my reflection someone I don't know?
Somehow I cannot hide
Who I am, though I've tried.
When will my reflection show, who I am, inside?
How I pray, that a time will come,
I can free myself, from their expectations
On that day, I'll discover someway to be myself, and to make my family proud.
They want a docile lamb,
No-one knows who I am.
Must there be a secret me,
I'm forced to hide?
Must I pretend that I am someone else for all time?
When will my reflection show, who I am inside?
When will my reflection show, who I am inside? I know you
I walked with you
Once Upon a dream
I know you That gleam in your eyes
Is so familiar a gleam
Yet I know it's true
That visions are seldom what they seem But if I know you
I know what you do
You'll love me at once
The way you did once upon a dream La da la da la ahahahahah
But if I know you
I know what you do
You'll love me at once The way you did once upon a dream
I know you
I walked with you
Once Upon a dream I know you
That gleam in your eyes
Is so familiar a gleam
Yet I know it's true That visions are seldom what they seem
But if I know you
I know what you do
You'll love me at once The way you did once upon a dream There's a calm surrender to the rush of day
When the heat of the rolling world can be turned away
An enchanted moment and it sees me through
It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you And can you feel the love tonight? It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer that we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight? How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds believe the very best There's a time for everyone, if they only learn
That the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours And can you feel the love tonight? It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer that we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight? How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds believe the very best
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds believe the very best Ou mata e matagi

Moana, make way, make way!
Moana, it's time you knew
The village of Motunui is
All you need The dancers are practising
They dance to an ancient song
(Who needs a new song? This old one's all we need) This tradition is our mission
And Moana, there's so much to do
(Make way!)
Don't trip on the taro root
That's all you need We share everything we make
(We make)
We joke and we weave our baskets
(Aha!)
The fishermen come back from the sea Moana:
I wanna see Chief Tui:
Don't walk away
Moana, stay on the ground now
Our people will need a chief
And there you are Chief Tui and Sina:
There comes a day
When you're gonna look around
And realize happiness is
Where you are Chief Tui:
Consider the coconut
(The what?)
Consider its tree
We use each part of the coconut
That's all we need Sina:
We make our nets from the fibers
(We make our nets from the fibers)
The water is sweet inside
(The water is sweet inside)
We use the leaves to build fires
(We use the leaves to build fires)
We cook up the meat inside
(We cook up the meat inside) Chief Tui:
Consider the coconuts
(Consider the coconuts)
The trunks and the leaves
(Ha!)
The island gives us what we need Moana:
And no one leaves Chief Tui:
That's right, we stay
We're safe and we're well provided
And when we look to the future
There you are You'll be okay
In time you'll learn just as I did
Chief Tui and Sina:
You must find happiness right
Where you are Gramma Tala:
I like to dance with the water
The undertow and the waves
The water is mischievous
Ha! I like how it misbehaves The village may think I'm crazy
Or say that I drift too far
But once you know what you like, well
There you are You are your father's daughter
Stubbornness and pride
Mind what he says but remember
You may hear a voice inside
And if the voice starts to whisper
To follow the farthest star
Moana, that voice inside is
Who you are Villagers:
We make our nets from the fibers
(We weave our nets from the fibers)
The water is sweet inside
(And we taste the sweet inside)
We use the leaves to build fires
(We sing these songs in our choir)
We cook up the meat inside
(We have mouths to feed inside) Chief Tui:
The village believes in us
(That's right!)
The village believes
(Ha!)
The island gives us what we need
And no one leaves Moana:
So here I'll stay
My home, my people beside me
And when I think of tomorrow
There we are I'll lead the way
I'll have my people to guide me
We'll build our future together
Villagers: Where we are Moana:
'Cause every path leads you back to
Villagers:
Where you are
Moana:
You can find happiness right -
Villagers:
Where you are
Where you are Don't you disrespect me little man
Don't you derogate or deride
You're in my world now, not your world
And I got friends on the other side
(He's got friends on the other side) That's and echo gentleman
Just a little something we have here in Louisiana
A little parlor trick, don't worry Sit down at my table, put your mind at ease
If you relax it will enable me to do anything I please
I can read your future, I can change it 'round some too
I look deep into your heart and soul You do have have a soul, don't you, Lawrence?
Make your wildest dreams come true I got voodoo, I got voodoo
I got things I didn't even try
And I got friends on the other side
(He's got friends on the other side) The cards, the cards, the cards will tell
The past, the present and the future as well
The cards, the cards, just take three
Take a little trip into your future with me Now you, young man are from across the sea
You come from two long lines of royalty
I'm a royal myself on my mother's side
Your lifestyle's high but your funds are low
You need to marry a little honey who's daddy got dough Mom and dad cut you off, huh, playboy?
Now y'all better get hitched but hitching ties you down
You just want to be free, hop from place to place
But freedom takes green It's the green, it's the green, it's the green you need
And when I look into your future it's the green that I see On you little man, I don't want wanna waste much time
You've been pushed 'round all your life
You've been pushed 'round by your mother
And your sister and your brother
And if you was married you'd be pushed 'round by your wife But in your future the you I see
Is exactly the man you always wanted to be
Shake my hand, come on boys
Won't you shake a poor sinner's hand? Yes, are you ready?
(Are you ready?)
Are you ready? Transformation central
Transformation central
Transformation central
Transformation central Transformafication central, can you feel it?
You're changing, you're changing, you're changing alright
I hope you're satisfied, but if you ain't don't blame me
You can blame my friends on the other side You got what you wanted
What you want's what you get
Hush Ain't it a glorious day?
Right as a mornin' in May
I feel like I could fly
Have you ever seen the grass
So green, or a bluer sky? Oh it's a jolly 'oliday with Mary
Mary makes your 'eart so light!
When the day is gray and ordianry
Mary makes the sun shine bright!
Oh, 'appiness is bloomin' all around 'er
The daffodils are smilin' at the dove
When Mary 'olds your 'and
You feel so grand
Your 'eart starts beatin' like
A big brass band!
It's a jolly 'oliday with Mary
No wonder that it's Mary that we love! Oh it's a jolly 'oliday with Mary
Mary makes your 'eart so light!
When the day is gray and ordianry
Mary makes the sun shine bright!
Oh, 'appiness is bloomin' all around 'er
The daffodils are smilin' at the dove
When Mary 'olds your 'and
You feel so grand
Your 'eart starts beatin' like
A big brass band!
It's a jolly 'oliday with Mary
No wonder that it's Mary that we love! Oh, it's a jolly holiday with you, Bert
Gentlemen like you are few
Though you're just a diamond
In the rough, Bert
Underneath your blood is blue!
You'd never think of pressing
Your advantage
Forbearance is the hallmark of your creed
A lady needn't fear when you are near
Your sweet gentility is crystal clear!
Oh, it's a jolly holiday with you, Bert
A jolly, jolly holiday with you! It's true that Mavis and Sybil 'ave
Ways that are winning
And Prudence and Gwendolyn
Set your 'eart spinning
Phoebe's delightful, Maude is disarming
Janice, Felicia, Lydia--charming
Cynthia's dashing, Vivian's sweet
Stephanie's smashing, Priscilla a treat
Veronica, Millicent, Agnes, and Jane
Convivial company, time and again
Dorcas and Phyllis and Glynis are sorts
I'll agree are three jolly good sports
But cream of the crop, tip of the top
It's Mary Poppins, and there we stop! If I never knew you
If I never felt this love
I would have no inkling of
How precious life can be And if I never knew you
I would never have a clue
How at last I'd find in you
The missing part of me In this world so full of fear
Full of rage and lies
I can see the truth so clear
In your eyes
So dry your eyes And I'm so grateful to you
I'd have lived my whole life through
Lost forever
If I never knew you If I never knew you
I'd be safe but half as real
Never knowing I could feel
A love so strong and true I'm so grateful to you
I'd have lived my whole life through
Lost forever
If I never knew you I thought our love would be so beautiful Somehow we made the whole world bright I never knew that fear and hate could be so strong
All they'd leave us were these whispers in the night
But still my heart is singing
We were right If I never knew you
There's no moment I regret
If I never knew this love
I would have no inkling of
If our time has gone too fast I've lived at last
How precious life can be I thought our love would be so beautiful
Somehow we'd make the whole world bright I thought our love would be so beautiful
We'd turn the darkness into light And still my heart is singing
We were right We were right
And if I never knew you
I'd have lived my whole life through Empty as the sky Never knowing why
Lost forever I know you
I walked with you
Once Upon a dream
I know you That gleam in your eyes
Is so familiar a gleam
Yet I know it's true
That visions are seldom what they seem But if I know you
I know what you do
You'll love me at once
The way you did once upon a dream La da la da la ahahahahah
But if I know you
I know what you do
You'll love me at once The way you did once upon a dream
I know you
I walked with you
Once Upon a dream I know you
That gleam in your eyes
Is so familiar a gleam
Yet I know it's true That visions are seldom what they seem
But if I know you
I know what you do
You'll love me at once The way you did once upon a dream You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
When the road looks rough ahead
And you're miles and miles
From your nice warm bed
Just remember what your old pal said
Boy, you've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
You've got troubles, well I've got 'em too
There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you
We stick together and we see it through
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me Some other folks might be
A little bit smarter than I am
Bigger and stronger too
Maybe
But none of them will ever love you the way I do
It's me and you
And as the years go by
Boys, our friendship will never die
You're gonna see
It's our destiny
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me I have often dreamed of a far off place
Where a hero's welcome would be waiting for me
Where the crowds would cheer, when they see my face
And a voice keeps saying this is where I'm meant to be I'll be there someday, I can go the distance
I will find my way if I can be strong
I know every mile would be worth my while
When I go the distance, I'll be right where I belong Down an unknown road to embrace my fate
Though that road may wander, it will lead me to you
And a thousand years would be worth the wait
It might take a lifetime but somehow I'll see it through And I won't look back, I can go the distance
And I'll stay on track, no I won't accept defeat
It's an uphill slope
But I won't loose hope, 'till I go the distance
And my journey is complete, oh yeah But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part
For a hero's strength is measured by his heart, oh Like a shooting star, I will go the distance
I will search the world, I will face its harms
I don't care how far, I can go the distance
'Till I find my hero's welcome waiting in your arms I will search the world, I will face its harms
'Till I find my hero's welcome waiting in your arms I've got no strings
To hold me down
To make me fret
Or make me frown
I had strings
But now I'm free
There are no strings on me Hi-ho the me-ri-o
That's the only way to go
I want the world to know
Nothing ever worries me I've got no strings
So I have fun
I'm not tied up to anyone
They've got strings
But you can see
There are no strings on me You have no strings
Your arms is free
To love me by the Zuider Zee
Ya, ya, ya
If you would woo
I'd bust my strings for you You've got no strings
Comme ci comme ca
Your savoire-faire is ooh la la
I've got strings
But entre nous
I'd cut my strings for you Down where the Volga flows
There's a Russian rendezvous
Where me and Ivan go
But I'd rather go with you, hey There are no strings on me Come stop your crying
It will be alright
Just take my hand
And hold it tight I will protect you
From all around you
I will be here
Don't you cry For one so small,
You seem so strong
My arms will hold you,
Keep you safe and warm
This bond between us
Can't be broken
I will be here
Don't you cry 'Cause you'll be in my heart
Yes, you'll be in my heart
From this day on
Now and forever more
You'll be in my heart
No matter what they say
You'll be here in my heart
Always Why can't they understand the way we feel
They just don't trust what they can't explain
I know we're different, but deep inside us
We're not that different at all And you'll be in my heart
Yes you'll be in my heart
From this day on
Now and forever more Don't listen to them
'Cause what do they know
We need each other, to have, to hold
They'll see in time, I know When destiny calls you, you must be strong
I may not be with you
But you got to hold on
They'll see in time, I know
We'll show them together 'Cause you'll be in my heart
Believe me you'll be in my heart
I'll be there from this day on
Now and forever more You'll be in my heart
No matter what they say
You'll be here in my heart
Always Always I'll be with you
I'll be there for you always
Always and always Just look over your shoulder
Just look over your shoulder
Just look over your shoulder
Another one

Top down, JFK, I pray he get impeached
Say no names, Supreme underwear, and like eighty chains
Hundred for the rich forever perspective, never change

We The Best Music
DJ Khaled Please, Khaled, don't pair me or compare me
Unless the said party is a rare breed
The stories I hear, they tend to mirror me
At this point now, rap is only therapy
President Push, I'm more Eric B
I ain't no joke, check out my melody
Felony, felony, felony, that's all they selling me
But 2 million in large bills is billing me
I was on the wrong side of the law
Like Pac was on the wrong side of the car
Like B.I.G. at the Soul Train Awards
The moral is all grace been driven
G Wagons are bulletproof
The ones before me got snatched like bullet tooth
Tony nigga, only one left from the drug era
The jewelry weighs more in the drug mirror Yeah, what you see when you look in the mirror, nigga? Haha
Yeah, I know who the fuck I am Yuugh, tell me how you fit in
Was you a street nigga when Nas said it's written
When Reasonable Doubt dropped, how was you living?
I was leading up the grinding in my kitchen
Getting work from Detroit like a piston
We was on a mission, stuff it in a Michelin
I could spend a year reminiscing
The length of your career, reminiscing
We can't occupy the same space
We ain't even running the same race
When it come to these bitches, it ain't the same chase
Moynat versus lean, we ain't the same taste
Therefore, it's no comparison
To be mentioned with you niggas is embarrassing
I am one Joe blow, you know my narrative
Clear your sinus like Claritin
Push When you look in the mirror, what do you see, nigga?
'Cause I know when I look in the mirror, I know what I see
You peasants don't deserve my presence You portraying other individuals
Me, I'm just weighing my residuals
From where success is the bare minimal
You a rapper, I'm a criminal
I had money before they found y'all
That's why I feel funny around y'all
Lord, bless those praying for my downfall
If I get too deep, don't let me drown, y'all
Hearing 'em talking 'bout how to flip a key
Started moving that Daddy Kane and Nicky D
Had the whole YPD sick of me
Don't sit, if you get tired, just pick a knee
Bet it all or bet it large
Now the coke or these pills, the crack, all these credit cards
I just laughed and I shrug at it
'Cause the niggas with the money are the drug addicts
Kiss Another one

Keep your hands up get 'em in the sky for the homies

But they saying Luda's back
Blame it on that Conjure
The hood call it Luda-Yac
And I'm on this foolish track, so I spit my foolish flow
My hands go up and down like strippers booty's go
My verses still be serving, tight like a million virgins
Last time on a Khaled remix, now I'm on the original version
Can't never count me out

Got twenty bank accounts, accountants count me in
Make millions every year, the south's champion

Yellow bone passenger they see it, they say oh boy!

Ask you what you laughing at
Represent that mud life (mud life)
Dirty money bitch you better get your mug right (mug right)

Bust till I burst on 'em
Floss 'em up, toss 'em up, Hardaway, cross 'em up
Pardon me I'm bossin' up, pressure up, bless ya bruh
Don't mess with us
We like the "U" in the 80's
Back to back set a trap

Hit the trick, jump the track

Apologize if I say, anything I don't mean
Like whats up with your best friend?
We could all have some fun, believe me
And whats up with these new niggas?
And why they think it all comes so easy But get it while you here boy
Cause all that hype don't feel the same next year boy
Yeah and I'll be right here in my spot
With a little more cash than I already got
Trippin' off you 'cause you had your shot
With my skin tanned and my hair long
And my fans who been so patient,
Me and forty back to work but we still smell like a vacation
Hate the rumors, hate your bullshit
Hate these fucking allegations,
I'm just feeling like the throne is for the taking, watch me take it All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it till it's done
And I don't really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older so somebody shoulda told ya I'm on one, yeah,
Fuck it, I'm on one
Yeah, I said I'm on one fuck it, I'm on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be gotten and I'ma get that shit
Cause I'm on one, I said fuck it I'm on one I'm burning purple flowers
It's burning my chest
I bury the most cash and burning the rest
Walking on the clouds, suspended in thin air
Do ones beneath me recognize the red bottoms I wear
Burner in the belt
Move the kids to the hills (Boss)
Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill
Kiss you on ya neck and tell ya everything is great
Even though I'm out on bond I might be facin' eight's
Still running with the same niggas 'til the death of me
Ever seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully
Ever made love to the woman of your dreams
In a room full of money out in London as she screams
Baby, I could take it there
Call Marc Jacobs personally to make a pair
So yeah, we on one, the feeling ain't fair (Khaled)
And it's double M G until I get the chair All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it till it's done
And I don't really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older so somebody shoulda told ya I'm on one, yeah,
Fuck it, I'm on one
Yeah, I said I'm on one, fuck it, I'm on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be gotten and I'ma get that shit
Cause I'm on one, I said fuck it I'm on one I walk around the club,

And all my niggas got that Heat I feel like Pat Riley
Yeah, too much money, ain't enough money
You know the feds listening,

You niggas on the bench
Like the bus coming
Huh, ain't nothing sweet but the swishas
I'm focused might aswell say cheese for the pictures
Oh, I'm about to go Andre the Giant
You a sell out, but I ain't buying
Chopper dissect a nigga like science
Put an end to the world like Mayans
It's a celebration bitches, Mazel Tov
It's a slim chance I fall, olive oil
Tunechi be the name, don't ask me how I got it
I'm killin' these hoes I swear I'm tryna stop the violence All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it till it's done

If you from the streets like me, put your hands up!

Put em up! Say Khaled I'm going in so you can gon' bring in back

And like Rihanna fine ass, I'm gon' live my life
Ten bands and take one, call it being nice
Get your hands up and that's a direct order
Got my bands up, thanks to the transporter

With all the jewelry on, make sure I'm looking good
Rob who nigga? I wish a nigga would
Point 5, don't shoot, that's how the lames do it
Word on the street somebody put a hit on me
I'm in the foreign, top off, look like I'm worried homie?
Better send them now, got bout a mill on me
You rob me; I kill you, now that's a deal homie
Two-twenty-three
Carbon one-five
Old black bitch with me, that's that forty five
Been real, never snitched nigga my whole life
Heard a nigga whacked him. He shouldn't have testified [Chorus]
If you from the streets like me, put your hands up!

Put em up!
If you know this how you living, put your hands up!

Put em up! I'm hotter than a Kawasaki in the projects
Burning more than rubber, money ain't a object
I'm number 1, and hurt they feelings in the process
Cop a bird, then your really seein progress
I'm buying cars like I'm in a contest
Say my name, rappers lookin like a bomb threat
I'm the winner, these beginners talking nonsense
Brain from your ? till she render me unconscious
I'm so conscious of DNA in my closet
My show account can't take another deposit
Ladies heartthrob labelled me the odd ball
3.5 cause I'm known to start small [Chorus]
If you from the streets like me, put your hands up!
D Boys on my tease, put your hands up!
Independent bad bitches, put your hands up!
If you know this how you living, put your hands up!
Where they at?
Put em up! If you know this how you living, put your hands up!

Pussy so wet I'mma need Dramamine and mattress Aquafining
Boy I light the block up, young Billie Jeaning

Swimming with the dolphins on the Dan Marino
Wine mixing, this shit like the Catalina
B-I-G, minus Puff and Lil Cease
I'm on my grind, 3 AM text like I need ya
Dream about the pussy, fuck it I'm a dreamer
Hold me down but don't hold me back like I need you to, damn
I wrote myself a million dollar check in fifth grade
I put it on the wall and promised it'd be this way
She fuck me like she want the rent paid
Like she want that Oscar De La Renta

Then go back up at it like I hadn't had it
Straight up How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
I'll fuck you right, have you walking from side to side
How many times? Pour a cup for the bitches that ain't scared to get down

Light another for the bitches who's just only in town
For the weekend, ohh I see these bitches in Supperclub
Niggas got me throwing bottles up
Bottles with all of my homies
I'm feeling generous, throwing my money
She said she wanted the molly love
I gave her the dick but I'm not in love
I call out, "Bingo!" the minute I'm boning
Soon as I'm done, kick her out in the morning
Got xans when I turn up, it's a party, bust it open
Pop that pussy in a circle, go retarded, pop it for me
She got that booty galore, gripping it, backing me up
You wanna fuck with a thug
Now I see all these bitches got ass and they throwing
Damn, it's just a matter of time 'fore I'm gone
Drinking Ciroc and I know that she got it for free
I hit up Diddy, he told me he did it
He said that the liquor just bring out the freaks
Them bitches lit, dropping that ass to a split
Talking 'bout me, I'm the shit
I just get down for the money, the bitches, and cars
And my niggas, they whipping the bricks How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
I'll fuck you right, have you walking from side to side

Hey, yeah (we the best) All I do is win win win no matter what
Got money on my mind I can never get enough
And every time I step up in the buildin'
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there
And they say yeah
And they stay there
Up down, up down, up down
'Cause all I do is win win win
And if you goin' in put your hands in the air
Make 'em stay there (Luda!)
Ludacris goin' in on the verse
Cause I never been defeated and I won't stop now
Keep your hands up get 'em in the sky for the homies
That didn't make it and the folks locked down
I never went no where
But they saying Luda's back
Blame it on that Conjure
The hood call it Luda-Yac
And I'm on this foolish track, so I spit my foolish flow
My hands go up and down like strippers booty's go
My verses still be serving, tight like a million virgins
Last time on a Khaled remix, now I'm on the original version
Can't never count me out
Y'all better count me in
Got twenty bank accounts, accountants count me in
Make millions every year, the south's champion
Cause all I do, all I, all I, all I
All I do is All I do is win win win no matter what
Got money on my mind I can never get enough
And every time I step up in the buildin'
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there
And they say yeah

Up down, up down, up down
'Cause all I do is win win win
And if you goin' in put your hands in the air
Make 'em stay there Swerving in my lo-lo,
Head on the swivel
You know serving me's a no no
Clean as a whistle as I pull out in my Rolls Royce
Yellow bone passenger they see it, they say oh boy!
Tell Khaled back it up, my n****s call me Loco
Down for armed trafficking, don't make me pull that fo-fo
Ask you what you laughing at
Represent that mud life (mud life)
Dirty money b**** you better get your mug right (mug right)
We come together holding hands and holla thug life (thug life)

It's like f*** life
(All we do is win)
You riding or what (what!)
'Cause we riding tonight (night!)
Now she riding with me cause you wasn't ridin' her right, All I do is win win win no matter what
Got money on my mind I can never get enough
And every time I step up in the buildin'
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there
And they say yeah
And they stay there
Up down, up down, up down
'Cause all I do is win win win
And if you goin' in put your hands in the air
Make 'em stay there Heat in the kitchen, pot on the stove
Water getting boiled, dope being sold
Snoopy in the hoopty, system overload
I've been runnin' this rap game since I was twenty years old
I hung with the worst of 'em
Bust till I burst on 'em
Floss 'em up, toss 'em up, Hardaway, cross 'em up
Pardon me I'm bossin' up, pressure up, bless ya bruh
Don't mess with us
We like the "U" in the 80's
Back to back set a trap
Hit the lick, get it back
Hit the trick, jump the track
B**** I want my money back
Time and time again while I'm sipping on this gin
Al Davis said it best, just win baby win All I do is win win win no matter what
Got money on my mind I can never get enough
And every time I step up in the buildin'
Everybody hands go up

Two seaters every season, and I just begun
Aquafina, she dripping puddles on a sunny day
Multi-million dollar plays and that's a hundred ways
Fuck a fashion, we come mashing out her man's seats
Top down, JFK, I pray he get impeached
Say no names, Supreme underwear, and like eighty chains
Hundred for the rich forever perspective, never change
Petty bitches posting niggas like they were wedding pictures
Evidently, I'm getting richer, tricking seven figures
Ain't no difference when you see or that's on television
Chasing a hundred million, baby that's my natural ambition
Boss All my life, that's on everything, yeah
This forever, I put that on everything, yeah

That's on my life, yeah, yeah I took my life and bossed it up
I took the risk, coin tossed it up
I just left work to work some more, I'm still a workaholic
I done sacrificed it all, paid the dues and costs
Life will test us all, let's see if we true or false
I walk up to my fate and stared that shit in the face
Hungry for the competition, bitch get on my plate
No mercy, no grace, I'm checkin' off my to-do list
There's no room off in the schedule its only room for improvement
And I realized all I needed was in me, nigga
S on my chest boy, so shots can't even pinch me, nigga
No substitute for me, but they gon' still tempt me nigga
God is in me, that's the only one who can end me nigga
And we seen more blessings than a Baptist Ebenezer
My daddy says you got a good girl, she's a keeper
Boy, I'm a Caesar, I see shit and seize it
Roc-A-Fella chain, but you can still get Ethered
Yeah, they don't really fucking feel me man, but when you really run it they try and clip your Achilles
I'm on track to a billi', I got Khaled fuckin' with me

Doing what I gotta do
What up though?
We the best music
I guess I'm on my Don shit
What that mean?
I'mma go
DJ Khaled Straight up, late nights mixed with early days
It'll probably be that way until the Pearly Gates
Stress weighing on me, they want me to nervous break
These hoes showing fake love when I prefer the hate, man (Sheesh)
At least if you real then I have to respect it
Realize the energy you give is what you manifested
So understand we positive as could be
The vision is still intact, the show is fresh out of seats
Boy it's never going south 'less we down in South Beach
Khaled on the jet skiis, preaching what you believe in
Everything fast 'cept the food, watch what we eating
If it add a couple years to our life, then we might go vegan
Woah, I hear a little bit of me in all your favorite rappers
You know it's true, bitch I need respect due
Now or later, either way I'mma take it, just like it's fuckin' taxes
No wonder I'm on fire, I done been to Hell and back bitch
Lately I been living life in detachment
I practice seven spiritual laws and cut off distractions
We been all in the Hollywood Hills, and never been acting
Detroit gave me an accent and Christ gave me his passion
Father help us, police doing target practice with real bodies
Mommas in the streets, crying, standing over a still body
Niggas over stressing, we under investigation
Every day off to the races, can't fuck with you if you racist
Beat your ass until you purple, they can't even tell what your race is
Doctor King meet Dr. Dre, except this doctor lost all his patience
Have you tied up in a basement with you and your partner facing adjacent
Until you deposit payment or reparations
If you shoot me then you gotta deal with a holy me
It feel like I'm finally free and unlock my spirit with the holy key
(The holy key, the holy key, the holy key) And I'mma celebrate it for a long time
The drama couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key
And I'mma celebrate it for a long time
The drama couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key Everything I touch may disintegrate into dust (Uh huh)
Everything I trust may dishonor me in disgust (Come on)
Everything is everything, affidavits and wedding rings
Out for blood on my higher horse, I report what it was
I don't wear crosses no more, Yeshua's coming back
I ain't scared of losses no more, I see life in that
I don't resonate with the concept of love and hate
'Cause your perspective is less effective and rather fake
The universe and the heavens work in my DNA
Kendrick said "Fuck Mother Earth," that's PSA
The land of the wicked, the foundation of Lucifer's spirit
Walking zombies and spellcatchers, I pray for forgiveness
Uncle Bobby and Paul June is lost again
The underworld and the fourth dimension, my family's in
The big money, the fast cars, my life produced
The blocks I connected while re-building this Rubix cube
So what you look up to?
Fame and fortune, bitches, Porsches, sources with designer thing
Brand endorsement joining forces with sorcerers signing me
Law enforcement their forces, tortures us with violent speed
Fuck your boss's employment my joy is to see all you bleed
Who knew Royce's with choices of color my desire need
Crab and Oyster with gorgeous abortions, I require thee
Flesh and poison the point is the reason, you won't die in peace
Open door for my boy, now they eating, we say, finally
I destroy and divorce what you eating, don't you hire me
Tape recording my voices and tweak it, let's play hide and seek
War distortion and forfeit this evening, you should try at least
I'm restoring the portrait of feasting, nigga, I am beast
I don't like to sleep, I'm up like coyote, I might OD
Hair like ODB, I'm off a higher need
Khaled is valid, I been looking for inspiration
But when you the only king, you the only one in the matrix And I'mma celebrate it for a long time
The drama couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key
And I'mma celebrate it for a long time
The drama couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key Holy, Holy key, holy Yeah, yeah yeah yeah (ohh, yeah)

Nigga!! [Chorus] Classic shit, timeless, forever, iconic
DJ Khaled! A divine leader
Shine brighter, bonita mami meet a line sniffer
Never, poetic rhyme writer, chiefer
Ebony empress getter
Celebrity Apprentice a devil show
Big up to Africa, Mexico
Hennessy, margarita, venison eater
So dear spread 'em here, don't be actin' innocent either
Dome me, relax me, it's only to the nasty
I'm just a phony assassin
A lot of niggas owe me, I'mma tax 'em
A lot of sisters hold me to somethin' holy and Catholic
'Cause the rosary and gold flashy
Just an attachment and accessory to my dress code
Now everywhere all I see is Pablo, Esco
Last time I checked I was still breathin'
My neck was still freezin', now everybody got an Escobar Season
To every baby on the album cover existin'
This trend I was settin' it came to fruition
I'm assistin' to push the culture forward
To all my go supporters, go support us
Like a local black-owned grocery store
'Cause in the hood shit ain't passed down through blood
It's a dub on that
We get government aid
Spend it at they stores, puttin' they kids through college
We need balance, so we can lease and own Ds in our projects
So I'm askin' Gs to go in their pockets
The racial economic inequality, let's try to solve it My signature fade with the Bevel blade
That's a major key
I told her she smart and loyal, I like that
That's a major key
Start a label, run it, sign yourself
That's a major key
What Tony had on the table
It's like us, we a major key Still underestimated, every mistake a lesson
Mercury retrograde, so if that planet spin backwards up in the heavens maybe
It's effectin' back on niggas who don't be reppin' lately
I'm playin' chess with babies
Niggas is nursery
Niggas impersonatin', rehearsin' me
Nothin' like me, I'm the first of me and that's quite certainly
So official, come get this issue, some women crazy
I like a woman to show me wisdom
These hoes easily convinced to pop their pussy with a loaded pistol
Y'all ain't meant to be played
Says the brother with the signature fade
Still paid, stackin', new stash
Went from hangin' with shooters and clappers
To computer hackers
Check the fashion in Monaco
Gettin' ocean mist on my HSTRY hats
Khaled called me when I was in album mode
So I put it on hold for the Major Key
My album done, niggas, wait and see Classic shit, timeless, forever, iconic My signature fade with the Bevel blade
That's a major key
I told her she smart and loyal, I like that
That's a major key
Start a label, run it, sign yourself
That's a major key
What Tony had on the table
It's like us, we a major key Another one

Come to the winners circle, a lot of men will hurt you
But I'm here to nurture, I wanna take you further
She got all them purses, I say in my verses
YSL and Hermes and barely scratch the surface
She know on purpose, as I peel the curtains

Ran away with his money just to chill on the Island
All my bitches is stylin'

Fuck with me baby, it's Tunechi baby
Buss a nut, smoke a blunt, now I'm rejuvenated
With all that pink on, bitch I'm King Kong
I eat her ice cream, she eat my ice cream cone
Pop a pill and pop that pussy

And she kiss me on my neck and she kiss me on my chest

Now we gon' get fucked up, no excuses no apologies Keep your circle tight
Trust no one, nobody (nobody, nobody, no no no)
DJ Khaled! Gotta be careful who you trusting
Be aware of your surrounding when you hustling
Them niggas smiling at you ain't your friends, dawg
All the real ones are dead or in the pen y'all
You fuck with dude, he your day one
Almost had it all then the day comes
When they walking through your house with the strap out
Pointing at your head, got the bread then you black out (yeah)
Bright lights down the hallways
Left his best friend for dead for the small wage (ay)
They say that every dogs got a day coming
It's like he seen a ghost but he ain't say nothing
Eyes wide shut like you looking at me
Window pain to the soul say they niggas happy
But the pictures ain't say them words and we dry stomach
The homie didn't keep it one hundred
The cops doing roundups, say they got a suspect
Finally got a name now, I'm still thinkin fuck that (fuck, that)
For money, niggas murder what they close to (get this nigga)
Entire families these mother fuckin' ghost you
Smoke you, was it worth what the life was?
Just prepared for the payback because it strikes cuz
Was it worth what that life was?
Prepare for the payback when it strikes cuz Cuz when you need it the most ain't no one ever around
Cold world, cold world Yo, the pain's unbearable, remains unaware-able
He fuck around jump off a building if you dare him to
The greats they done already killed him, who you compare him to
Figure out what he said will take a year or two
Family over everything, skills over politics
He don't need the accolades as long as you acknowledge it
Just playing the hand you was dealt, no aces
Betrayal is worse than death in most cases
The world is filled with hypocrites that's so racist
Multiple shots to the face, No chasers
Mad cause you blew up quick and you excited
Your man that you grew up with get you indicted
This was your nigga, yo, for him you let the trigger go
Found out at the trial they got audio and video
Shit don't always happen how you plan it
Get jammed up and really find out who your fam is
You could feel the picture, you don't need to see the canvas
That nigga Jay'll Hawk you, he don't even play for Kansas
You know when it's someone you love the hurt's pure
You front tryna hold it in, it hurts more
He was right there back-to-back with me, my first war
Even had a crack spot together, the first floor
Used to buzz em in then meet him right by the first door
That was 'prolly a year before I went on my first tour
Friendship was worth more than a couple of ounces
He was 'sposed to be with me arguing with the bouncers
Instead you ended up somewhere far in the mountains
Talking 'about what we was doing, what we was counting
Nothing but old pictures of old sixes
Old BM's with the kids, old snitches
Two sides, both wishes
Karma is the sister of life, they both bitches See there's a story in my life
There's a story in my pain
There's a story in my tears, oh-oh oh
There's a story in me Yeah, for life
Lord forgive me for my sins, I was chasin' ends
And I'm into makin' money, I ain't in to making friends
Cause these niggas rattin', I ain't finna take a chance
Homie said he 'bout that action they grabbin' me take the stand, damn
Say loyalty make a man, got a homie and he told
I don't even shake his hand, I don't even crack a smile
Knew him since a child, man this game so foul
But niggas made vows to a code I never break
Ridin' in the heavy weight
Thirty-six O's in the bird, call it feather weight
Never on time, when I show up I be ready late
Niggas got fat while we starved they already ate
And I'm trying to get full, masks on clips full
If he got the money we attack him like a pitbull
We sellin' soft, we sellin' hard like it's a brick store
On my dick, nigga, thought that's what your bitch for
Hah! My pain ain't never been told (ain't never been told)
All the success that I'm suffering from
Came from this knowledge I sold (this knowledge I sold)
My family fucks with me
And fought the enemy that stood in my way (my way)
That's why I don't trust nobody
And I doubt you'll ever see that day
Where I surrender to you (surrender), surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you, surrender to you
Which I will never do 'Cause when you need it the most ain't no one ever around (nobody's around)
Cold world (cold world), cold world (mmm, yes it is, yeah)
And the ones that you keep close are the ones will take you down (always take you down)
Cold world (cold), a cold cold world Where I surrender to you, (surrender) surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you, surrender to you
Where I surrender to you, (surrender) surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you, surrender to you
Which I will never do
Oh-oh oh whoa
Oh-oh (oh-oh) oh-oh See there's a story in my life (Surrender)
There's a story in my pain (Surrender)
There's a story in my tears (Surrender)
There's a story in me (I won't Surrender, I won't surrender, oh no no no) [Repeat: x4]
I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from I do it for the hood cause the hood told me I could If the they hatin' on you don't stress
Tell them niggas that we the best (Fuck nigga you can't stop this)
Fuck the best we run this game
Kanye West Khaled and Pain [Chorus]
If you could you would get rid of me
What you gonna do when a nigga got to go hard
But I won't let you get to me
You should already figure I'ma go hard
If you were as real as me
You would never let another nigga step in your yard
Makin' money ain't shit to me
This in my veins and it gets to my heart
So I am, I will, I gots to go
You got another way to live you gots to go on
I am gettin' it in until the end I got to go, go, go, go hard [Kanye West]

This finna' be another classic bitch
Everybody know I got if you want it then get at it
But I ain't goin' have it
No I ain't goin' have it [Chorus] [Kanye West]
I ain't never been scared
Never been a type to bite my words
When I came up ya'll gave me shit
Now I'm finna make ya'll eat them turds
Always said what the fuck I felt
Goin' head spit that murder I wrote
Man I don't care what you felt fuck you nigga I know I'm dope
Dope like I'm comin' to get my all
Felt like I had to play the fly on the wall
Felt like niggas was stuntin' on me
Funny how I'm flyer then them all
Now I'm at the top ain't know where to go now
Instead of men she goin' go down
Maybe I would of slowed down if I knew what I know now
I'm Scooby I know I'm dumb
It cud get fuckin' old but it's good I'm young
But my heart get cold as the hood I'm from
Tell me what it take to be number one
I guess it's gon be what it's goin' be
But here's one thing you got to hear
I'm a tell you like George Bush told me
Fuck yall niggas I'm out of here [Chorus] [Repeat: x4]
I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in I go hard, for the hood

Bentyaga with the brain bust open
That new Mulsanne got the brain bust open
Play them racks like Jimi Hendrix on the guitar
Load my gun cock it back then I push start
I can't name how many times they tried to clone me
I can't name all the names that tried to clone me
This dirty money help me see the devil
Sadity thots, know they ain't forever
My trials and tribulations playing out on blogs
Spent three hundred thousand or better that's on all the cars
That Maybach park itself, nigga
That range rover came with steps, nigga
Electric tables in the back I'm eating filet mignon
He been .44'ing all year I put the Rollie on
Trapping good all year put the Rollie on
They parading in the streets you gotta keep a drum
Said a prayer for my young nigga, know he dumb
The murder rate going up nigga, I done ran this check up nigga
Get hit up from the neck up nigga, yeah
The Goyard looking like a graveyard
Murder money, I'm in love with murder money
Old friends of me turned into my enemy
My money and fame changes niggas into enemies
All my hard work and lonely nights no sympathy
Want to send a hit but too far in the industry
I feel your energy I know you niggas envy me
They rep the gang that bangin' it out in penitentiary
I watch the shit come out your mouth and it's finicky
I'm tryna love you but I doubt I'll scream infinity
With these billions on my mind it's hard to be cohesive
Gettin' that A-Rod money like I hit the needle
Keep a Spanish mamacita like a Fanta liter
And I gave 'em all dope and they pissed off
Got my lil Haiti babies waiting so they can wack ya
I got my Memphis ten niggas waiting to jack ya
I got some DC niggas waiting to kidnap ya
I got the clappers, finessers, and the trappers
Before the rap shit, you gotta go dap 'em
Don't forget to look a nigga when they after ya I told Future I can see the future
Told my bitch I love you 'fore I knew you
I know I'm blessed nigga Hallelujah
I'm grateful and if you diss me then I might shoot ya
Brrr you don't fuck with me the feeling mutual
Fuck you, half these rap niggas owe the jeweler (fuck 'em)

New Porsche, condo, living room cars in it
Ace of Spades with the Percocet and bars in it
Real soldiers, young shooters put they heart in it
They talk 'bout all this money we make and all these niggas they hatin'
Let's talk 'bout runnin' that bag up fast 'cause we ain't got no patience
Let's talk 'bout poppin' strips and xans like we 're patients
And the fed's allegations have you pacin'
Million dollar dope boy I gotta be grateful
You tryna get that 100 mil I'mma race you
Dope boy, I ain't never wanna be a rap nigga
Billboard reporter "LA Reid just sign a trap nigga"
New York Times read "Jay Z just signed a trap nigga"
Kitchen like "it's Thursday, you heard?" Might bring it back nigga
You fuckin' the money up if I'm being honest
Gotta be grateful I never break the promise
I know my plug love me, I know my bitch hate me
I heard my hood salty I tried to tell 'em it ain't my fault
It's just my blessings called me
But since they hatin' on an nigga I'mma keep ballin'
And I ain't textin' that bitch back because she keep stallin'
If she ain't fuck the first night then she just miss her callin'
Fuck a plea, I'm goin' to trial poker face I'm all in
Patek Philippe, the AP, 40 mil I'm all in
Plug hit my line I act like I ain't see 'em callin'

Even though you in the hood I'm still pullin' up
Dip, dip, straight to your doorstep
This the real thing, can you feel the force yet I always wonder if you ask yourself
Is it just me?
Is it just me?
Or is this sex so good I shouldn't have to fuck for free?
Is it just me?
Yeah, is it just me?
Is this sex so good I shouldn't have to
(Would you fuck me for free?) Another one
They don't want me to have another anthem
So I made sure I got another anthem
It's We The Best OVO
Summers ours
It always has been
Don't ever play yourself
One time for Future the Prince
One time for 40
One time for Drake
Another one
Bless up Yeah
We The Best Music
DJ Khaled Please, Khaled, don't pair me or compare me
Unless the said party is a rare breed
The stories I hear, they tend to mirror me
At this point now, rap is only therapy
President Push, I'm more Eric B
I ain't no joke, check out my melody
Felony, felony, felony, that's all they selling me
But 2 million in large bills is billing me
I was on the wrong side of the law
Like Pac was on the wrong side of the car
Like B.I.G. at the Soul Train Awards
The moral is all grace been driven
G Wagons are bulletproof
The ones before me got snatched like bullet tooth
Tony nigga, only one left from the drug era
The jewelry weighs more in the drug mirror Yeah, what you see when you look in the mirror, nigga? Haha
Yeah, I know who the fuck I am Yuugh, tell me how you fit in
Was you a street nigga when Nas said it's written
When Reasonable Doubt dropped, how was you living?
I was leading up the grinding in my kitchen
Getting work from Detroit like a piston
We was on a mission, stuff it in a Michelin
I could spend a year reminiscing
The length of your career, reminiscing
We can't occupy the same space
We ain't even running the same race
When it come to these bitches, it ain't the same chase
Moynat versus lean, we ain't the same taste
Therefore, it's no comparison
To be mentioned with you niggas is embarrassing
I am one Joe blow, you know my narrative
Clear your sinus like Claritin
Push When you look in the mirror, what do you see, nigga?
'Cause I know when I look in the mirror, I know what I see
You peasants don't deserve my presence You portraying other individuals
Me, I'm just weighing my residuals
From where success is the bare minimal
You a rapper, I'm a criminal
I had money before they found y'all
That's why I feel funny around y'all
Lord, bless those praying for my downfall
If I get too deep, don't let me drown, y'all
Hearing 'em talking 'bout how to flip a key
Started moving that Daddy Kane and Nicky D
Had the whole YPD sick of me
Don't sit, if you get tired, just pick a knee
Bet it all or bet it large
Now the coke or these pills, the crack, all these credit cards
I just laughed and I shrug at it
'Cause the niggas with the money are the drug addicts
Kiss DJ Khaled Wild Love I know I said Nas album done

For them it was hustle or death, I reshuffled my deck

Resort to violent reactions, that's childish
My life's a dream to rappers
Afraid they moments have past 'em
It's all different hustle (straight up)
Niggas movin' bricks
Young niggas rappin', doin' shows, hittin' they licks
Everybody hold this money in thicks
Don't get robbed, boy, is you dumb?
All them swipers gettin' it how it come (Yep)
43, morally ambiguous, you serious?
Gettin' it, lyricist, idiots, you ain't nearin' this
Out of New York's biggest and richest
I'm the template, low-key the busiest
The game chose me, deal with it
So I'm the quiet type, Mr. One Mic
But silent listen, use the same letters to spell it right, so hear me

I'm addicted to winning and I can't be benched
Go to war for every black queen that they lynched
And my pockets on chubby but they can't be pinched
After they use you, then they abuse you
Then they get mad when they lose you
(Excuse you)
You know the liar will accuse you
You know the queen still reign, it's just business as usual
Anything I touch, I bless it
Track record so impressive
Open the Billboard Awards with a hit record
The devil thought he had me
But I rebuked him, got money and I'm still a baddie I just got back from where they said I couldn't get back from
And I thank God, I thank God that I made it
They surprised, they surprised that I made it

Gotta valet, can't leave mine in these streets
Can't carpool, the crew is too deep
Why tuck it all in? The jewels are too sweet
You should ball if you could
I be diggin' in my pockets
It ain't trickin' if you got it
And since a niqqa from the projects
Champagne out of a can would be the fly sh!t
And I'm a history major
Hood motivational speaker
Rap Led Zeppelin, best dressed list
Show you how to bubble off of large investments
Ya heard me, and this journey I'm the journalist
Line around the block to hear the words of the herbalist
Send ya girl to the Dominicans to perm her shit
Tell her tonight, we gonna see Nas return to his murder shit It's still Nasty, bone in the flesh
God's son, never gone, never left
King, I play every card in the deck
The whole world waitin' for what I'm goin' do next

Queens bridge represent state one
Nigga I'm on (come on!)

We have a power
We are alive I'm God's hit man
Chopard wrist band
New York crown jewel
No if and's
Top five, I'm the one, two, three, four
And the fifth man
Smoke a hookah in Istanbul
I'm quicksand
I'm 5 Mics, five points of light
Hit the stage like a meteorite
They wanna all hear Ether tonight
But we ain't beefin' tonight
That's history
So now when you mention me
Say I'm a mystery
Like six degrees or the seven hills of Sicily
I need a vasectomy
They resurrected me
But nothing is left for me
Just when you thought you'd seen the best of me
I take it a notch higher, yeah
Sip more wine than a Somalian
Get around town in a private Lear
And by sun down, I'm up out of here It's still Nasty, bone in the flesh
God's son, never gone, never left
King, I play every card in the deck
The whole world waitin' for what I'm goin' do next
And y'all already know I came from
Queens bridge represent state one
Nigga I'm on (come on!)

We have a power
We are alive Power, paper, palace is so high
Lookin' over skyscrapers, wildin' out in Dubai
Do I look like I never seen the better things?
Emerald ring, I chase cheddar mean
Pockets on swole since eighteen years old
Gettin' my dough, cigars are hand-rolled
From Guantanamo, Gallardo's, the car shows
The Narco Gestapo Optimo's
Cause I love the dough
More than you know
Still ain't reach the pinnacle
Braveheart general since 9-4
Got the belt to show
Certified classic
9-6, Street Dreams is blastin'
And no way, they wanna hire assassins
They still harassin'
I'm so platinum, it's natural
A niqqa is my acronym
Lights, camera, action and It's still Nasty, bone in the flesh
God's son, never gone, never left
King, I play every card in the deck
The whole world waitin' for what I'm goin' do next
And y'all already know I came from
Queens bridge represent state one
Nigga I'm on (come on!)

Hey, yeah (we the best) All I do is win win win no matter what
Got money on my mind I can never get enough
And every time I step up in the buildin'
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there
And they say yeah
And they stay there
Up down, up down, up down
'Cause all I do is win win win
And if you goin' in put your hands in the air
Make 'em stay there (Luda!)
Ludacris goin' in on the verse
Cause I never been defeated and I won't stop now
Keep your hands up get 'em in the sky for the homies
That didn't make it and the folks locked down
I never went no where
But they saying Luda's back
Blame it on that Conjure
The hood call it Luda-Yac
And I'm on this foolish track, so I spit my foolish flow
My hands go up and down like strippers booty's go
My verses still be serving, tight like a million virgins
Last time on a Khaled remix, now I'm on the original version
Can't never count me out
Y'all better count me in
Got twenty bank accounts, accountants count me in
Make millions every year, the south's champion
Cause all I do, all I, all I, all I
All I do is All I do is win win win no matter what
Got money on my mind I can never get enough
And every time I step up in the buildin'
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there
And they say yeah
And they stay there
Up down, up down, up down
'Cause all I do is win win win
And if you goin' in put your hands in the air
Make 'em stay there Swerving in my lo-lo,
Head on the swivel
You know serving me's a no no
Clean as a whistle as I pull out in my Rolls Royce
Yellow bone passenger they see it, they say oh boy!
Tell Khaled back it up, my n****s call me Loco
Down for armed trafficking, don't make me pull that fo-fo
Ask you what you laughing at
Represent that mud life (mud life)
Dirty money b**** you better get your mug right (mug right)
We come together holding hands and holla thug life (thug life)
We all strapped in all black
It's like f*** life
(All we do is win)
You riding or what (what!)
'Cause we riding tonight (night!)
Now she riding with me cause you wasn't ridin' her right, All I do is win win win no matter what
Got money on my mind I can never get enough
And every time I step up in the buildin'
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there
And they say yeah
And they stay there
Up down, up down, up down
'Cause all I do is win win win
And if you goin' in put your hands in the air
Make 'em stay there Heat in the kitchen, pot on the stove
Water getting boiled, dope being sold
Snoopy in the hoopty, system overload
I've been runnin' this rap game since I was twenty years old
I hung with the worst of 'em
Bust till I burst on 'em
Floss 'em up, toss 'em up, Hardaway, cross 'em up
Pardon me I'm bossin' up, pressure up, bless ya bruh
Don't mess with us
We like the "U" in the 80's
Back to back set a trap
Hit the lick, get it back
Hit the trick, jump the track
B**** I want my money back
Time and time again while I'm sipping on this gin
Al Davis said it best, just win baby win All I do is win win win no matter what
Got money on my mind I can never get enough
And every time I step up in the buildin'
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there
And they say yeah
And they stay there
Up down, up down, up down
'Cause all I do is win win win
And if you goin' in put your hands in the air
Make 'em stay there DJ Khaled (DJ Khaled)
